Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation, and particularly the single market, can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often take the form of cross-border proceedings, the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles, thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly.	5.190536361885486
Given this context, I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago.	3.247887861047528
In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective.	5.482667994282866
One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued.	5.335579621329181
I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today' s debate.	4.322354206173454
The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless.	6.058332106818991
Quotas alone are not enough.	3.4395661774480897
We have also asked Parliament' s own DG IV to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the Committee on Fisheries.	5.181884488709606
As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account.	5.5598759930065835
But given this situation, which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique, we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique' s leaders, both those in the government and those in opposition, who, out of a sense of responsibility, have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems.	4.449154527272274
Consequently, the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment. Instead, it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues.	5.666988951811197
On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika.	3.565905335886703
I believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned.	4.457115010597649
Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry.	5.225401658069002
This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries.	2.8278318629139276
This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine.	5.238225890539632
The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received.	5.378713524349783
Finally, Mr President, as I must be brief given the time constraints, I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the important work which she has carried out within our committee.	4.446075631356711
You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000, under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance, Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture.	5.428806139905822
Under this system, and given the total allowable catch for a species, a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the rightholders can trade amongst themselves, fish themselves or lease the rights to other fishermen for a certain time.	6.580664314551165
The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics, and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear, because this report is a radical one.	5.551318900237207
If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future.	4.699934418342374
The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying, as the Commissioner has already said: around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees, waiting for a helicopter to come and save them.	5.994108526030311
State intervention has always led to a high level of debt, and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment, as well as social justice.	5.014057517535083
The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme.	5.39604865827658
Those could perpetuate an infection.	4.978632505340593
The PSE Group of this House has suggested that preventing natural disasters, including preventing conflicts, is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of Mozambique.	4.99988807125454
What about women?	2.4407166910101403
I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure.	4.281458933675756
We therefore all agree on the established facts, and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction.	4.023152770244751
To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong.	6.917647792257958
It is that bankruptcy is experienced within the European Union, in the majority of States, as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects.	5.122419760068938
I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special, spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong.	7.066526596587347
A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements.	5.691782914126579
This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that, because Europe has to wake up.	4.433855513750866
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.6156125826162198
It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread.	5.6967934686835475
Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA.	5.824326781740412
Mr Fischler, I am delighted that the Commission responded favourably to our request in the last and constructive debate which we had on this issue and has asked to attend our next meeting this month to inform us about the future preparatory ICCAT meeting.	5.5731908367411
This policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth.	5.2152301574512
What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of?	6.435688814622528
But you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year.	6.840096257692956
Although these floods began three weeks ago, the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits Mozambique currently finds itself in: there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport, particularly air transport, to get them out of the situation they are in.	6.241469438831048
Shipwreck of the Erika	2.491873336375411
The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow.	5.347640940237356
This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups.	4.979476115382333
Mr President, I do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues, who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers' health.	5.078466673703949
We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations.	5.7556442193217565
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there remains, however, one immediate problem: the need to provide help for all Mozambicans who have been afflicted, many of whose lives are in danger, in their flooded villages, hoping that they will be rescued.	4.923624538343206
I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening.	3.7731981578003255
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9, but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join, at the same time, environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies.	4.306659987273583
Nor can it be done, if the proposal involves a threat to public health.	3.213558547510132
The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community programme and an extended Community programme.	6.1675669167290055
I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals.	5.4418177189538195
So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other.	4.602679681745258
Maritime transport, employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment.	4.750405304308398
Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway.	5.47460870384131
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects.	4.936760113802723
Thirdly, we must expect things to change gradually.	4.644842596660043
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.	1.5612705178678616
And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen.	2.211781275506418
I can partly accept Amendment No 11.	4.298972059152534
The Mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles.	5.311129140376246
Your votes, colleagues, in favour of my report in full, as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee, will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others.	5.192926430090722
The French State has released funds for compensating damage.	6.0272890633192215
If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique.	7.2747344370465035
The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations.	6.15337321023057
There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions.	4.58812759964643
We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data.	3.9703231509584103
So further thought is necessary.	4.440244423598504
That appeared in the communication published last July.	4.757141634769086
Many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it.	6.279712530674649
In recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth EUR 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence.	5.937095785283704
A5-0038/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community framework for the collection and management of the fisheries data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 541 - C5-0302/1999 - 1999/0218(CNS));	4.008794940247508
I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach, the European Union is taking exactly the right line, not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted.	5.110815542295985
Unfortunately my colleagues of the People' s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable.	5.6954774136668185
Commissioner Fischler, of course, knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries, along with his lusty colleagues, because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland.	4.762775010235299
Are we ready to pay for those resources?	3.6087845972209887
The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001.	4.945246109200769
The PSE Group has always supported the Commission' s humanitarian aid policy.	3.578482760621701
It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals, namely that the Union' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments, partly in order to involve all the Union' s citizens in the information society, something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view.	4.539142314889554
It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally.	3.3613994263368743
Because they have to face social obstacles. Because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest.	4.76862897247493
Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission' s proposal, in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish, but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy.	5.085735637254927
This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish.	6.335253796065849
It does not matter whether you come from Galicia, it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland.	4.554556694044069
The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention.	4.06069188888152
As he said, fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend.	5.92061477216151
The applicant States ought not merely to tag along behind but, instead, share the EU' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field.	5.157899001740648
It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects.	4.647425803898682
Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions.	4.686668948350679
I have therefore asked the European Commission to produce a publication which lists all the measures of the common fisheries policy aimed at conserving and protecting resources. This will serve to publicise our protectionist actions.	5.102324608276792
How can those affected be compensated?	4.71355571892761
At present dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system.	5.325487115742271
There is therefore a need for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment.	2.1756792069482795
We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies.	5.647971428846399
If I may, however, just make a few comments on the method.	2.8068092419553365
It is simply a budgetary policy which can be coherent with price stability but which also allows us to have an appropriate monetary policy which contributes to growth.	5.147500172639576
We basically highlighted the possibility of encountering difficulties in terms of growth in the USA, and therefore in other parts of the world, and of a sudden rise in inflation.	3.8624928532964775
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90/424.	5.301010989052268
However, according to the SCRS study, the regulation establishing the 6.4 kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean fisheries.	6.320725823455293
We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities.	4.66721423286109
Several people have lost their lives, many have disappeared, many have been injured.	4.489944603917804
In conjunction with these changes, Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly.	4.3622445161176975
We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth.	4.705375367016279
This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur.	6.0761294694192785
Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, twenty two thousand at Unilever, ten thousand at ABB/Alsthom Power, not to mention all the others.	6.8978908804423105
To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted.	5.245264310960749
I am, moreover, proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the Council.	4.463091191639792
For if we must preserve the shoals of fish, we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen.	3.638467129215491
Council Decision 90/424 constitutes another instrument for Community financial support in case of disease outbreaks.	6.367941736246572
That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism, as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD.	5.923597561062295
The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector.	4.891663064825541
These initiatives, together with effective systems of control, are the key aspects for the future of fisheries.	4.058997273973111
The international community including the United States of America, Switzerland, South Africa, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance.	3.6498821761265363
Yesterday, when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent.	4.796841814417495
Indeed, the Commission feels that Parliament should instead support Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the Commission, assisted by a regulatory committee, in accordance with the on-going procedure of Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC.	3.8763061605499085
Our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital.	5.030944463926716
Secondly, even the growth rate of 3 or 4%, something we consider eminently feasible, will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth.	4.981163278822911
Thus, Amendment No 6, while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations, requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission.	5.25153737478011
At its recent meeting in November 1998, the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations.	6.1640431945302465
Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure.	4.506026927505597
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority.	4.561510273390806
We also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and, what is more, concepts.	4.174875740408948
However, I believe that there are also some elements of consensus.	3.398364700509484
And this is happening in a country which, because it is one of the poorest in the world, does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary.	4.085270027352261
Furthermore, this view was accepted in the Commission' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses.	4.662807757273161
Our rapporteur' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded.	5.1956392298285925
This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 7.	3.7067583844866703
First of all, from 1986 to 1989, I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique.	5.142635918238871
There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster.	6.185195587645873
Commissioner Nielson is flying out today. In European terms, this may be swift action, but given the emergency in Mozambique, this is probably very late.	5.417434900648406
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.1021863052220615
What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular.	4.181244275880401
The first is to establish equivalence, saying: in the final analysis, bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany.	5.458611757124812
Mr President, the Katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals, notably, of the Europe for a Union of Nations Group, which were adopted in the Committee on Fisheries and, in my opinion, this version is an improvement on the original.	4.027961243855712
An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd.	5.436470623582711
As I have said many times before, the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika.	3.773309188171895
He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this.	3.939982359769746
This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States.	4.139348177375986
Such pressures are greatest in Europe.	5.325024878085578
Mr President, as a member of the Verts/ALE Group, but also as a Member of this Parliament for Galicia, I propose to use this intervention to enlarge upon two issues. I shall, of course, be brief.	3.3281385278740006
Wild salmon, trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment.	6.525982043980476
Secondly, that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society.	4.8960583476014135
Therefore, with regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 4. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2, on the idea of "centre of the debtor' s main interests" .	2.918668111897263
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.8855853135096431
Instead of always following behind the United States, in Seattle, in Kosovo, in Iraq, perhaps the Europe of Brussels could suggest, over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the North Atlantic, in the Pacific, over and above the regulation of tuna, cod or other things, that Europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing, a kind of Montego Bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between Peruvians, Japanese, Canadians, Russians, Europeans, and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity.	5.585063018233226
At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent.	4.457870284571094
That is scandalous, their case ought to be heard.	5.298083744302673
Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting.	6.041148155773814
Our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects, among other factors, the imbalances in our labour market.	5.176384675106394
We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity, but also from domestic activity.	5.600394543327898
I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance.	2.0265144433043405
But of course, as others have said, this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate, woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness.	6.1753159310855565
The time has also come to demand greater efficiency.	4.660524314599862
Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens, not just in farms affected by ISA.	6.1127793242411315
In particular, I have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon, the need to investigate the source of ISA and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks.	5.098634162766622
Today, in many Member States, that is not possible.	2.410094207928947
It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it.	4.824205866852457
With regard to the environmental impact, it is a well-known phenomenon that while stocks have fallen during the last decades several reasons have been advanced to explain these reductions: pollution, over-fishing, changes in climate, etc. It cannot at present be excluded that ISA has an impact on wild stock.	5.6173882203626455
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets.	4.553558990683707
In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches, fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures.	6.462878487582783
Now I believe, Commissioner, this is not good enough and that in the future we must learn and that reports must be submitted to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee before decisions are taken, otherwise then we are nothing further than a rubber stamp and I know that is not the intention of the Commission or the Commissioner but let us learn from mistakes of the past.	4.988306857070995
Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea.	3.9235470488609376
We have that opportunity right now. Let us grasp it.	5.883363581092165
What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high, and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market.	6.77510675946099
Moreover, with regard to the protection of coastal areas, which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish, we hope for tighter controls, which, in our opinion, should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea.	4.291745654987362
The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation.	4.701715411709777
We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated.	4.113972175580602
The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced	3.7357684640321795
This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.	5.724800903310361
The Commission' s legislative delay on certain issues should not surprise us, but for the fact that this is a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organisations on the protection of such a threatened resource as tuna.	4.348048581218517
The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders.	3.6342511639676447
It should be put on record, and I want to put it on record today.	4.029797760522113
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries.	4.794887926519669
The third route that has been taken is in the end to superimpose above the existing systems, which are not touched, a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty.	5.537792179839028
The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry.	6.0575017266724505
For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances.	3.509988469514395
Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland.	6.961636274900966
Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties.	5.028137183691738
But I must say that despite the scare-mongering of the Greens, it has to be emphasised that ISA cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans, and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said, that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold-water species.	5.756095996247841
The common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect, perhaps more so than most people, both Europeans and non-Europeans, would believe.	4.6902304580343115
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.7809448841568021
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift.	3.78155522353205
The construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas?	5.789543998319466
The common fisheries policy is not working.	1.7674638299058627
Mr President, Commissioner, I have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the Union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my Group' s spokesman, Karl von Wogau, for the document that we are debating today, and which has had a report written on it, points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success.	3.6694943905386164
However, we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities, differences, varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries, and that they will not be disregarded, penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies, as has sometimes occurred in the past.	4.887314401993373
The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear.	6.393703004526777
They say that if you want something done, it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea, the fishermen, must be very attentive.	4.425106367514638
It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data.	3.096508393782713
This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all.	5.238392323780986
Firstly, fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin.	4.544046680392055
The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data.	4.9732125351570176
The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection.	6.00023984212336
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole.	5.708393088111575
As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts.	5.155876331158595
It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union.	5.335531065075803
They urgently need aid such as food, water and shelter in order to survive.	4.473376686947492
This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities.	5.750915144320285
If nothing is done now, we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help Mozambique in its development go to waste.	5.56904397232529
More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity.	5.48261374450583
Mr President, behind the report, which is an honest one, by Mrs Attwooll, which we shall vote for, we see the European fisheries policy. It is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea, which is immense and without borders, it is not easy to manage fish on the move.	4.790394773098373
Just when we thought the discussions had ended, a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly.	5.469133278359935
I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish.	4.63520718361194
Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation.	5.033064460083213
A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country' s fishing industry.	3.5292127223494907
This has happened, as previously mentioned, with the MAGPs. These have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the Commission, compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data.	5.230986637954158
More than three hundred people have already died, six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced, two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off, with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated, some of whom are in treetops, others on roofs.	6.263638212420632
This is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people, both within the EU and between the EU and the applicant States.	4.056673371336121
It is true that Mozambique' s democracy is still far from perfect, as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them.	4.898790218107604
We must do this not only in line with basic humanitarian principles and out of solidarity, but also - and quickly - because we know that Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world. This means that its resources for coping with the tragedy and then setting about reconstruction are practically non-existent.	5.075047081994111
The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one.	4.4233375644629245
The very word bankruptcy, the legal concept of bankruptcy, does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union.	5.130141849034374
There is also no doubt that, throughout the debate this afternoon, we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies.	4.482943705264767
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million.	4.559638264044025
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report is exciting.	4.410753711059886
It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level.	5.59323179716615
These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention.	6.471248642292277
I must emphasise, however, that there are serious constraints.	2.719752495048662
On paper!	-0.0
In Norway, with their much longer experience, compulsory, 100% culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation.	5.665091632880239
Since, however, the Community is funding the exercise, it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment.	4.961092005563729
It would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans-European networks, which have been gathering dust in the drawers for rather too long, to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of European Community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to borrow for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact.	5.830970932758025
Four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable.	5.669775971907683
These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates.	6.361633537277022
The Commission' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument.	4.205446846362883
There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims. The water levels continue to rise.	5.415336005836051
The Commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem.	4.367755006463025
One can quote from the communication.	3.295184065946362
So we must practise selective fishing.	4.5051969007272294
Firstly, private investment must be assisted.	4.024623784792602
I believe that the political message of this Parliament should consist of something more original than a mere rehash of the neo-classical economic mantra.	5.4016112715826745
The ecological disaster is a major one, possibly unprecedented in scale.	3.716914885019669
It has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by Member States at a later stage.	4.247151647783127
The EU' s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors, on most of which I believe we agree with Parliament' s analysis.	3.6343752557944504
We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution.	5.4243354037443225
Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it.	5.43110816259902
The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with.	2.9460037618799975
This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission' s report.	3.832873190964606
As has already been said, helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid. Otherwise, apart from the tragedy created by the floods, the next tragedy will arise: that of a lack of aid to the people, who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods.	4.793776059027486
In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway.	2.136829847250485
These amendments by the Green component of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13.	4.160522933940269
My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns.	5.4157485968858
This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish, whether diseased or not, from an affected farm from being sold and I must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold.	6.120993438812957
Thanks to the grass-roots involvement, which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January, an initial raft of measures has been announced.	5.569505713731517
And just as well, in my view.	2.18994195147177
I think it is an important step we are taking, even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it.	5.02210784791049
In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances.	6.322143361741069
As regards fishing proper, passive gear fishing is currently the hardest hit.	6.01074824552843
It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified, where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two.	6.180538908181175
Solutions cannot be found at the last minute, when the disaster is already in progress.	4.677974635738714
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion.	2.37622381888875
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made.	3.765097714868359
Brussels, which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task, now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset.	5.129900554434961
This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us.	5.271357321989536
Secondly, in respect to the environmental data, the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information.	5.468927523540333
A5-0037/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by the Member States in collecting data, and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 551 - C5-0303/1999 - 1999/0224(CNS)).	4.110347261246458
Read Mr Katiforis' s report again, in which he says that in Scotland, for example, 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that I just mentioned, and impact upon the environment.	5.166630751425586
That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide.	5.1032260525084086
This is the basis of my request to the European Commission and the services of this House.	3.0384564826718456
This intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the European Union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic and the adjacent seas including the Mediterranean.	5.990759514423955
Together with Mrs Attwooll, I am in favour of collecting scientific data, and of fair and accurate checks, on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the laxness of the administrations. I am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists, like Professor Aubert, or others, that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing - although it plays a serious and negative part - but more to do with plankton, the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers, which have a much greater effect than human influence.	5.838503475220175
85% of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is.	4.56221703565246
The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate.	2.8024406335365035
It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned.	3.954714736781378
However, I also agree with Mr Gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the tardiness of the Commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into Community law.	6.677230239462342
We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector.	4.664378512317419
However, some people' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic, ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators.	5.57100014889618
Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport, particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling 'responsible fisheries' .	6.131247069599165
The proposed changes are twofold: the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle.	5.822681405280746
But to enlighten the decision makers, let us practise honest science, without the ulterior motive of having the European Union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats.	6.340726243551841
After shellfish, the slump is now affecting crustacean sales.	6.340921167670374
Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vendée, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis.	4.707599462310345
I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources, and I also welcome the Commission' s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour, in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life.	4.951607509724189
Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes.	5.820475760502139
It was not the Commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two Member States, Germany and Finland, by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which Member States share with the Commission on such issues.	4.471066630649176
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us. Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports.	4.295746231731633
On the other hand, it does not accept Amendment No 4.	1.7427821939829888
First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires.	5.250608071134012
These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation.	5.533921413835181
I would stress that the whole of the CFP must be revised, particularly the part on the protection of fish stocks.	4.184567566618284
I understand I have been described in a Spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things.	5.575106751010694
What policy should we use to achieve these objectives?	3.497530962827797
I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term.	4.054793636070868
Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment.	4.883387844560264
Lastly, we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left.	2.7017874818344025
We all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good.	4.018561163837844
There is a saying that the dead tell no tales and I am sure they do not eat fish but I do and I look forward to the implementation of this report.	4.522508395074229
I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals.	7.037016766143572
I do not feel in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13.	4.170666486116307
With regard to Amendment No 6, we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee. I am a little surprised that you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not support it then.	4.375679106425834
The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible.	5.0194124265199385
It is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters, followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid.	6.409215477949275
If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years' time about the future of the policy.	4.541934170030005
However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution.	4.992586064179185
In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense, without any real negotiation or discussion.	5.7554397968313635
Mr President, Mrs Attwooll' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States. This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002.	4.626082423290755
This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics, finances and administration, compliance and conservation and management measures.	6.365103888551809
The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon.	6.060799752400511
Are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still stuck in a mould of old political contradictions?	5.516592816423136
Apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees.	5.9878610728872275
The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika.	3.4142517634133203
I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management. This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory, as with the MAGPs.	6.25871886504934
What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities?	2.497977896724161
The measures agreed in November 1998 are binding since 21 June, I repeat 21 June 1999, months before the communication was forwarded to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee and 9 months almost to the date.	6.276737586296649
What options does the Commission have, to offer effective help fast?	5.200953370169375
It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours, as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people.	6.969071460277758
I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise.	3.886675247993524
I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that.	4.916423945524617
As a king sport fisherman myself, I would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when anglers from the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to 830 pounds.	6.095803932878383
We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission, with plenty of action and no more regrets.	4.483818834089111
What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues.	3.9123738141773865
My conclusions about this differ completely, however, from those of the previous speaker.	4.398616831392817
As a result, this report is very satisfactory and, on behalf of my Group, I therefore ask for its approval.	3.2389407199530105
For all of the high-minded talk about conservation, the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster.	3.8851849267661516
ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996.	5.093070442470478
I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission.	3.8249261496893983
Thank you, Mrs Kinnock.	2.5044599250716613
The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects.	4.659494794960846
Mr President, all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique.	4.64074060655378
However, this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA.	4.680107624540307
The body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna.	4.736442115617849
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today.	2.929014959979482
However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations.	4.285374008379749
They will be concentrating on the reinstallation of displaced people, on the further prevention of outbreaks of malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases, on the provision of supplementary food to malnourished and children at risk, on the provision of seeds and tools, on food security, on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters.	5.536664108446378
Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set.	5.020463630093462
Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union.	4.780874078090473
I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea, and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean, when we want to clean up purification plants, is a good way to clean up water.	4.924028666297308
As far as Europe is concerned, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, where there is a quota for the involvement of women, it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation.	3.4174214794997813
The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health.	2.767596235133454
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	1.0872788258869468
On behalf of the PSE Group, I want to send a message of solidarity to those affected, to the fishermen, farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market.	4.001667471757659
I would like to think that the EU is up to the task of providing the people of Mozambique with what they expect from us.	3.733633451712139
We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods.	3.6868131531850135
Mr President, the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick, two and a half months after the wreck of the Erika, is because the extent of the economic, social and ecological disaster affecting our Atlantic coastline is, in fact, far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand.	3.9216329801056338
Mr President, over two months after the wreck of the Erika, pollution of the coasts, which have already been cleaned once, is still continuing.	4.223060470516286
It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and, if possible, eradicated.	4.310006906034012
In its original form, it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy.	6.259209811563938
It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine, in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock.	6.692560749889135
As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union.	6.077488573328771
Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts, who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas, failed miserably to muster any support.	5.227359434412625
According to these, for example, the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea.	5.680801159944577
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics. Because women have to deal with different realities.	5.331793812256991
Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	2.541363921543792
In terms of outlook, the document points to an upswing, to long-term prospects and the measures required to achieve this, which Karl von Wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon.	5.953104389416373
This was the first pillar of my recommendation.	4.2739230325205195
We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vendée are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious.	4.876838933407043
The latter element continues to be the Commission' s fundamental objective, as we indicated in the Prodi document submitted for your debate at the Lisbon Summit, in that we are aiming for full employment in the medium term.	4.870849889234475
And people have spoken in the past about BSE.	4.2355609729993065
The European Commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as DIPECHO. This was intended to be proactive and, using a regional approach, to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population.	5.509008870725167
It is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions. This will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity, thus enabling our society to grow, together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years.	5.557832201736251
When we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market, we must also deal with the darker side, namely bankruptcies.	2.844405843950255
The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves, which have been totally rejected out of hand, for the conservation of their own fish stocks, then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard.	5.638633799277958
I look forward to Parliament' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward.	4.563902946381068
Mozambique, which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster, just as the famine now threatening in Ethiopia was foreseeable, is excluded from these plans.	5.745986353304052
It is as if the whole world is looking on, helplessly.	4.362360093585957
I am not sure that I can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity.	5.712522552048647
As far back as 1981, the Commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings.	5.9673693111090955
So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report.	4.232321158184953
If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history.	7.158274587521215
Indeed, it is good to note that the forecast of 3% growth for the year 2000, which could have seemed rather bold when the Commission announced it in November 1999, now has a serious chance of being achieved, even in the context of continued inflation, since the peak of 2% for the euro zone in January, nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past.	4.972361633483497
Because they have a different level of education.	2.865697565339254
The virus harms cold-blooded animals.	5.781615690375037
I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process.	5.818053225639498
The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly.	3.9189334369296316
I think that, in this way, the European Parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the European Union where a very wide, socio-economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly.	4.657014251230335
I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average.	5.377453724098227
This is a good step forward, but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out, much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States.	4.837637359769511
This comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site-to-site transmission, security measures to curtail escapes, treatment of waste and effluent, methods of detection and diagnosis, farrowing and rotation, disinfection of equipment and many, many more.	6.173417403121906
We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen.	6.8309311497900405
The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique, as I have myself, and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake.	5.01072136451001
Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable.	4.461980537077242
The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause.	5.198021717825826
Apparently, according to my information, the Fisheries Directorate-General sent a note last January to the Trade Directorate-General which is still on the preparatory work.	5.402694119698972
To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy, the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows.	5.80626804485546
I also can partly accept the part of Amendment No 6 saying that Directive 93/53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence.	5.409259521626238
While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this, I should like to salute the dedication of the workers, professionals and volunteers, who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches.	5.276818864891178
These NGOs will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation, provision of shelter, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, blankets, those sorts of things.	6.039471691186668
Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community.	5.195286800500257
There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation.	5.152046526806122
Secondly, the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party.	3.9881889707066467
Lastly, the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors' White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services.	5.1271269349437505
The industry is located in some of Europe' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities.	5.1280803474043735
We welcome the report' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system, as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States.	4.064520609217435
However, we do not have to resort to extreme solutions, as Mr Katiforis initially suggested in his draft report.	4.88939620037916
Mr President, it has already been said that, after a war which engulfed the country in misery, Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions.	4.893965886640796
As of now, it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos.	5.773517405428142
The debate is closed.	0.1492237954198763
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.9634871405566788
The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner.	4.529333300653269
It is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk.	4.874665366564192
So, yes, appropriations must be released at Community level to support the cleaning of the contaminated coastlines, to assist the organisations which went into action to save oil-covered birds, and to contribute towards getting the affected businesses back on their feet.	5.840715274060361
Helicopters are therefore needed.	3.46788491448414
When we submitted our report, we referred to the risks posed by growth.	4.899144730998516
By now, my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice.	5.0836719868107405
Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial. Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising.	5.770875379052394
This report is a wake-up call to Europe.	1.780661830589566
It is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of ISA is needed.	5.31538466972199
Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled.	3.049035982399873
In this context, a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open.	3.555267150300205
The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced.	4.697631448820822
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts.	5.894516368678816
Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level.	4.808751715707723
Mr President, the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people, it is the generalisation of insecurity, of low wages, of deteriorating working conditions.	4.808825878697452
If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again.	4.724037219250077
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine.	6.11829434507973
Mr President, Mr Fischler, my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues, as discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen.	5.041476500252322
We all agree that, after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment, certain action must be taken.	5.263285510792197
The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner.	3.835903573010735
Much of this data is confidential, as has also been mentioned, which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises.	4.65241831810564
As Mr Katiforis says, discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept.	4.465823727308871
Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million.	6.0383372492973
The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future.	5.329509897940045
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.8563561571484081
I recommend the report to the House.	3.466529828323053
As for the Structural Funds, certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day.	5.026298812048463
It is time that polluters started to pay because, up to now, it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid, and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well.	4.972597280538196
The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans.	6.385196556472055
This is an unwise policy.	3.9174144438618743
With this vote, the European Parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it, by supporting an extreme neo-liberal economic and social policy; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything, categorically opposes any form of public sector, overturns workers' employment, wage, social and insurance rights, imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti-social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and employable if they want to find a job.	5.994518424415905
The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets.	5.437454085601029
As I pointed out earlier, the available scientific evidence is that ISA is not a threat to health.	5.117017580797926
The next item is the report A5-0017/2000 by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament: Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment (COM(1999) 363 - C5-0176/1999 - 1999/2155 (COS)).	3.988682464770756
Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents.	7.080888302209088
Bearing this in mind, I can agree to accept Amendment Nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter.	4.737629473202117
A central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19%, to which it has fallen over the decade, to at least 23-24% of GDP, both in the private and in the public sector.	4.492912497055099
All workers in the fishing, fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard.	5.27293257234377
This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually, however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice.	6.580833334687359
It is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources, but what is the point if Europe restricts its catches and world catches increase?	5.518047520908761
Moreover, several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus.	5.502901386189009
As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets.	4.76272859364096
This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	3.9315562412787974
In no way, however, can diseased fish be used for human consumption.	4.088468528075884
We hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon, the Commissioner' s knowledge of the situation in Mozambique and the visit by Mr Nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help Mozambique.	3.683378454099023
Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked.	5.004678797648836
Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment	3.90717040383103
Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers.	6.25339480719419
Moreover, it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface categorisation of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly: in reality, in some cases, small-scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources.	4.541011650346993
The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon.	5.129508484894901
We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution, to development, to the urbanisation of coastal areas, etc. But we should also think about restoring the environment and, for example, solving the problems associated with caulerpa taxifolia, and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected.	4.614047043028786
Mr Nielson will be happy to report back to Parliament on the findings of his mission.	3.6723638855175573
To fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow, not just for our fishermen and the people of Europe but, more seriously, for humanity as a whole.	6.00512736296956
Mr President, this Parliament, which has shown itself to be highly Europeanist so many times, must, on this occasion, show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of Europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures.	4.137053500377169
What is the point of destroying the French fishing fleet, at Sète or elsewhere, for example, if every year France has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed, while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it.	6.132509830747447
Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries.	4.433278334009122
This immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics, which have apparently already broken out, and aid for reconstruction.	6.05280872825748
The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself.	6.715219899632939
I believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with Infectious Salmon Anaemia which is both practical, realistic and also achievable.	5.205972721166571
However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws.	4.279729010248839
I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee.	6.53750681316102
Common fisheries policy	-0.0
In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector, as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs, I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector, we will end up with total confusion. For example, some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources, according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data.	4.78712015548646
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce.	3.224155507505541
Following all of the research, the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August.	7.110923405046054
There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen.	4.115887012903293
It is not very easy in coastal areas anywhere in the Union to defend the European Union in the whole area of fisheries, but I have been defending them on the grounds that decisions are made on properly based scientific knowledge.	4.916023974565396
They were bravely dealing then with huge environmental and political problems, with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war.	4.715978899119565
It will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40%, as proposed by the Commission, has been very greatly watered down by the Council, to between 5 and 10%.	4.149548464668005
I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one, for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy.	4.581591529925509
We want to continue along the successful European path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market, to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures.	4.47624893581113
Thirdly, the European Union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in Community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources.	6.274114478262437
One of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between the European area, for example and the United States, is precisely this ability of bouncing back that exists on the other side of the Atlantic and that we just do not have here.	5.557462635396613
Employment is growing at a good rate.	3.948035110060821
From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP.	5.165448266618608
The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vendée and Loire-Atlantique regions.	6.685076234755651
How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country.	5.844179538387393
Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was, moreover, based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years.	4.564285715947318
All of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the Community level and in the various international fora in which the Community participates.	5.987800662182437
Since then, the Fisheries Council meeting of 16 December decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000.	6.439952119526183
We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment.	4.856259157593232
Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event.	5.562112567803434
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 Convention on insolvency proceedings.	3.603304081386984
We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable.	4.156551295044354
The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage. It must also indicate all the specific measures, including political, economic, social and financial measures, which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight.	5.662785493495709
A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases.	4.911988873996199
I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report.	5.657990411025471
We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats.	5.140273982077278
It appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective, for example, by type of fish stock.	4.957914251288583
It will be voting against it.	2.0112395365434734
I cannot understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some Member States to slip without any penalty and I cannot understand either that within a European Union where we are only 50% self-sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information, that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk.	5.561896867596694
.	-0.0
Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured.	5.608297508893646
Indeed, these floods and appalling weather have resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes and all of their possessions, people who cannot return to their homes after the storms, purely and simply because their homes and their belongings no longer exist. They are no longer there, having been swept away in the torrents.	5.708141923397175
Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs.	5.067331955585519
This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy.	3.9439152197480176
We have always supported ECHO, its policies and its actions, even some which have been disputed by certain bodies. We believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the EU' s external action.	5.6828063063188266
The body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks.	5.546751871863652
I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4.	3.4021217850484766
I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate.	5.620872561540768
I should also like to say that my Group shall remain vigilant and committed, in collaboration with the grass-roots action groups, to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level, supported by realistic penalties in the event of non-compliance.	4.770964622931503
I do not suppose that anybody in this House would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms.	5.637197568975734
It cannot create jobs just by government spending.	5.563667011053703
The Commission is following with very great concern, as I know all honourable Members will be, the emergency situation in Mozambique.	4.917877629846896
Whilst the communication reveals the Commission' s worthy intentions in this field, it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made.	5.449708748994286
Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee.	5.481379954613199
Despite yesterday' s figures, we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2% in December shows that this is an issue which must be pursued. However, the rate of underlying inflation demonstrates that the inflationist tendencies are due to certain very specific elements such as the rise in oil prices and exchange rate developments.	4.987311345768606
This latter issue may be particularly significant if it causes cost-push inflation. This is why we are continuing to talk about the need for a wages policy compatible with the definitions of inflation which we want to establish.	5.185279266248085
I am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities, the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our Group has no difficulty in supporting these reports.	5.113256498328892
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.9100514535502789
Two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the Committee.	4.055587869712517
As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training.	5.046169323657499
Quotas are one of the ways, one of the policies needed to bring about change.	3.4596609471739415
But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency.	3.6499897111009996
Recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas.	6.230538194981555
Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue.	6.265200451939185
Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that, although the data are to be scientifically based, they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes.	5.484420744701675
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually.	6.537948982047323
The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age.	5.206723211121009
First, in respect to economic data, Amendment No 2 makes two changes.	4.741011438514455
Sound, factual information is in the best interests of the industry.	3.8731209059616036
In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed, we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient.	4.87603344185012
Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources.	6.923083334751255
This particularly applies, however, to our own coastal waters.	3.813507744157284
It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch.	6.440363293073332
Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%?	5.0492551074373635
The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed.	6.10416812543837
Thirdly, we spent much of this afternoon in this Chamber discussing conflict prevention, how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively.	6.482296292007724
And we should say so very clearly, it will involve more savings on services, more third systems, more reductions in average working hours, whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things.	6.294010859363792
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention.	4.219500297789077
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text.	5.860403865609134
More controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils.	5.288058511580441
The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms.	5.887250164490089
I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions.	3.8454547171754863
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings.	4.352440378467602
It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting. It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks.	6.755565488930809
We need public and private investment.	3.380977882007847
Regrettably, although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago, it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another.	6.149446825943156
These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities.	5.000000405328566
The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people.	5.756514634050799
It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision.	4.376451591568143
Something more robust than a call to surrender to the fatalities of the market economy, something more decent than opposing dutiful aims but denying them the means of their realisation.	6.270533290721812
I do not want to and cannot go into too much detail, Mr President, given the time constraints and also the interpreters' fees.	4.2534497284951485
Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died, we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops.	6.176561968314677
By recommending the introduction of a method of containment and gradual culling, similar to the system used successfully in Norway, the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence, not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto shied clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter.	5.508561738123581
But at this stage I should like to make an observation, which is not technical, but more philosophical and taken from practice.	5.108131375360172
On this we are clear.	2.517059764836306
Society needs, therefore, to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern IT infrastructure which also reaches small companies, poor regions and ordinary citizens.	5.573106890282068
I agree that such research is needed and I understand this is at present being organised in the United Kingdom.	5.769797027520347
It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution.	6.472625162542263
Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon.	6.097874103769194
Coincidence or fate has worked to bring together in this part-session both my report and Mr Katiforis' s report on fisheries and the environment. The oral question from our committee on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the accident involving the tanker Erika will also be considered tomorrow.	5.527139173276544
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I must thank this House for its serious and detailed work.	2.686330646229819
However, we should never blind ourselves to scientific research, we should never cease to gather information, we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and, if necessary, we should at least consider policy changes.	5.177838065832941
It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised.	4.808384293872116
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe, in fact, that it is more by luck than skill that there have not so far been any disasters due to the absence of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers.	4.332234114543705
The international community could also help Mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts, not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy, but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential.	6.135845175407453
But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where, when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union.	5.067397774024094
Thirdly, referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data, I very much hope that the Commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but I believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment, not the way that is suggested in Amendments 7 to 13, and I hope honourable Members will reject them.	4.991105535254021
We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation, representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique.	3.9384986312861683
Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises.	4.5261622985292895
In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information, economic as well as biological.	4.841268860560573
Consequently, the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand.	4.849689133409824
I too agree that Amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate, indeed Amendment 13 would not merely negate the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules.	6.488593801958392
This is the challenge.	1.995757975189999
This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600.	3.9877667247950965
I too want to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she said.	4.563293698441654
Mr President, the original version of the Giorgos Katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations, based on the precise observations of the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe, for a European Union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent.	5.140234858152928
Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 'Internal Policies' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion.	6.24933916373299
The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union.	5.495098967164752
It will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business, which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the agony of businesses that are no longer viable.	6.201588011064654
One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control.	5.118379802992378
In mixed fisheries, you cannot discriminate.	4.841193978151037
Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally.	4.8320602217243165
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far?	5.58092380815595
In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures.	5.312909397072273
I would like to touch briefly on these amendments.	3.9801292680849567
Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90% of the British aquacultural industry.	5.236074438146687
I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report.	4.945817929014599
I repeat, Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster.	4.855040081234858
This has been the major victim in recent years and any improvements in public finances must lead to improvements in public investment. However, this must be carried out with respect for our tax consolidation commitments.	4.842217178025621
Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable.	4.56778650174628
It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality.	5.71190314271796
In effect, this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management.	5.2915239082906895
As rightly said by the rapporteur, both measures are totally and fully justified which is why we have no alternative but to ask for their approval.	5.048860887505213
There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high.	5.348386620814246
Let me illustrate this with a topical example.	4.14306455237153
A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation.	6.209532239190982
This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe.	3.939379452274969
There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance.	5.979151793932951
There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place.	5.996651847316404
It is not easy, indeed I could speak for everybody in my constituency that live in the coastal areas too and say that they are agreed on one thing, that the European Union is the source of all their problems and all their difficulties.	5.003707474932672
The use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential, as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore, as well as in coastal waters.	6.206570568617626
After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation.	6.219804819152281
He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve.	5.501678767806598
Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing.	5.340742857713606
But as has been pointed out, the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial. This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual.	4.411348885725987
I can therefore agree to Amendment No 10 with the proviso that the words, and I quote, "of the highest possible standard" are replaced by "are safe" .	4.923794584705019
For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed.	4.318318943412704
I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4.	5.04908956310879
The debate is closed.	0.11744184721613084
In this context I am happy to partly accept Amendment No 1, taking into account, however, that scientific investigations are not done by the Commission but that the Commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the Member States.	4.374154382348686
We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience.	5.945701765048354
The next item is the report A5-0035/2000 by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 1626/94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean and for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (COM(1999) 552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222(CNS)).	4.447588084863055
That is not the route that has been taken.	3.4935668791982577
We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner.	4.024101550990261
We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there.	4.997604352399632
This is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment: search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid, including food aid.	6.208727981846825
The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women.	3.113579090588047
Protection of juvenile marine organisms	2.905095567079199
The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority, the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups.	6.194740875922566
Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing.	5.218878137034197
In view of all this, we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States, on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique.	3.8247915156343426
More significantly, under Amendment No 1, the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1(b) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective.	5.3547936771782885
There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue.	5.476713098889994
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.7733489757381783
Just before I say a word about the assistance which has been given by ECHO so far, perhaps I can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks.	4.958669549292993
This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness, of growth of only 1.9% per year throughout the 1990s, despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were, however, unable to consolidate.	5.488057079286588
The revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time-limited challenge facing us. We must completely overhaul, modernise or, if you prefer, update this policy in its entirety.	5.0976939551677845
It is therefore sad that, in committee, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously.	3.3619850891486216
There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe.	5.328775247423836
I must admit that I have my doubts about this.	2.925572873263786
We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you, as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board.	4.427672849595887
The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety, particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection.	4.901537617283825
These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly.	5.063326677973289
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	0.9596274896532544
ECHO is currently preparing a second decision for a further EUR 2 million This decision will be implemented through UNICEF, Action Contre La Faim, COSV, Nuova Frontera and Vireaid pending, of course, the reception and examination of their final proposals.	6.355102200043868
In particular, the communication calls for control of fisheries pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine aqua systems, improved measures for nature conservation in the marine environment, in the graded management of coastal areas, improved training, information transparency and a greater contribution from scientific research to fisheries management.	6.294798887438407
Because they have fewer opportunities.	2.9606327916705744
I am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but I must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too unconvincing to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us, have been expecting from us rather too long.	5.922772131496396
The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.	3.2768575898053114
At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen' s representatives, duly accredited, travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared.	6.6248509106017135
I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States.	4.564924230587478
For better or for worse, the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life.	5.3535292769991045
The vote will take place tomorrow morning.	2.4543054663420967
This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish.	4.912376987986412
We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy.	3.87281382375916
Mr President, the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years.	5.618624890509947
I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner.	3.7016578765081496
I must highlight the part of the report which states that, in 1975, with regard to the size of bluefin tuna, a minimum limit of 6.4 kg with a 15% tolerance in the number of fish was recommended for the entire Atlantic.	5.011205948313129
The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path, rather it makes dramatic statements such as: what we need is state intervention, not the extension and consolidation of the market economy.	5.084824572073322
It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail.	6.246311838075117
I was pleased to hear the statement which Commissioner Fischler has just made, and I take careful note of the commitments he made before this House.	5.17552042382829
The continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African region aggravated by the Cyclone Eline have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure.	5.601949837099989
The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue, subsidies, interest received, etc., with a reference simply to volume of sales.	5.3965804331967915
Fishing and the environment (Bergen 13-14 March 1997): 2nd report	5.718881795589124
But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation.	3.516833879183983
There have already been hundreds of deaths.	3.6792351638169656
I would like to say that I strongly disagree with Mrs Villiers' view that this is such an interesting debate.	3.751386288906778
The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations.	4.014071266551703
The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)].	3.9341608980601377
In our opinion, the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate.	5.109566547502156
As for the amendments, I oppose the amendments tabled by Mr Hudghton' s Green colleagues, that is numbers 7 to 13, not because I do not care about the risks to human health but because, according to scientific evidence, the virus does not survive beyond 25o Celsius and according to medical evidence, human beings at that temperature are dead.	5.363218208058517
My Group has included two reasonable requests.	4.751453843510033
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death.	6.419913153800865
The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious.	4.32215445062902
Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living, for without it, the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed.	5.550445439625399
The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures.	7.480519992822132
Furthermore, the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for a recovery plan for Irish Sea cod, effectively calling a halt to cod fishing in the Irish Sea between 14 February and 13 April due to the crisis in the species.	6.750766846008265
At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela, changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna.	6.517642408231616
Yet I have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the Council and Parliament procedure.	5.427667896663407
It is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which Mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way.	5.563044980985833
The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy.	4.604081085149947
The Commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor, whereas in France alone, over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an insane economy.	6.440781354952555
After all, the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies.	4.609307307596198
The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals.	5.590653177316346
In view of this problem, which seems to me to be the most serious, the Fisheries Committee report improves the proposal in certain important points, particularly with the rapporteur' s suggestion of more reasonable submission deadlines and the request for monitoring by the Commission.	4.937167488024973
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region.	6.538586129603676
With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate.	5.50455138349982
Mr President, I very much appreciate this report by Mr Katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment.	4.5633842753765315
The many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and, above all, the future of fishery products, an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years, now hangs entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs, unfortunately, of initial disenchantment.	5.489751565321528
One is to adopt the Commission' s own excellent, outstanding econometric analysis, and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible.	5.374374460193892
I consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard.	3.3293705187214133
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report?	5.3274067225358595
By recommending the research, development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate ISA, the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine.	6.256418354339643
The debate is closed.	0.15934436070337826
I hope that the mission by Commissioner Nielson and the Portuguese State Secretary will provide the information that this House needs in order to understand the current situation, and what the most urgent needs are, so that we can help the people of Mozambique, who genuinely deserve our help, in their struggle for development.	5.020825090583387
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this House' s attention - which was not really necessary, but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in Mozambique. I have some figures here, which I believe are the most up-to-date ones available.	4.229156695932947
The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms, privatisation, de-regulation proposals, as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit.	4.2888964740366164
The EU must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively, in terms of quantity as well as quality, and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this.	5.720119738343181
Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it.	5.203324592123442
What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased.	4.8596814487708935
This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming.	5.003986866198697
Finally, on the question of whether, as the product of quotas, we can be proud, I would reply categorically that I would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that I had managed to impose quotas on Greece, where the level of representation of women is 5%.	4.608487897448029
The procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in Community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact.	5.899766863065022
So it also has to do with environmental protection.	3.565888067870872
Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this.	5.733363170949877
What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report?	4.455245293134347
The credit for Mozambique' s success story must be shared equally by its government, by the opposition, but above all, by the people of Mozambique.	4.072427956071771
Mr President, the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency.	3.6742252222930167
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate.	5.281644649579854
It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon.	5.926868765114058
The debate is closed.	0.19492425941305316
Union Economy (1999)	4.176045695107689
And I believe that it is our responsibility, in an ever more rapidly moving economy, where everyone must have a real opportunity, to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise, and a second and a third chance, if necessary.	5.254431743777649
Some of them have already lost several years' worth of harvests, but the 50% to 80% slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the Atlantic coastline, and even those in the Channel and North Sea.	5.9929827368640565
What is the point of banning European drift nets in the île d' Yeu or elsewhere, if Japan, Korea and Tunisia use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch?	5.3518371940043705
This is the policy which the Commission has defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon.	4.303439843942992
More specifically, with regard to fisheries management in the Mediterranean, we are all aware that fishing in the Mediterranean is not governed by provisions on TACs.	3.990372118749466
How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained?	4.931094356646852
In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene, the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors.	5.486124915206995
Curiously, the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified.	5.7475251941672925
There is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high-quality information.	4.556089521344588
For that purpose, I propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the Commission. This is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods.	4.804457292311492
We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive.	5.570536395853903
There is a risk, however, that all the effort that has been made in recent years, after all the problems with the peace agreements, with which we are all familiar, will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on Mozambique over the last few weeks.	4.158849260931816
My colleague Poul Nielson is literally on his way to Mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the Portuguese Secretary of State to assess the situation on the ground.	6.2826145194942296
Thirdly, we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe, but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital.	5.106371426428638
We shall now support your Amendment No 6, but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee.	5.4779302723290675
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back.	5.783509430585772
I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy-piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear, proper economic and biological picture emerging.	6.947364004469269
Fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks.	5.930045007531144
It is certainly not my task to judge other people' s alliances but if the People' s Party and the Liberals are so desperate to cement their alliance, let them at least propose something positive, something that has a chance of working, not repeat the same tired old platitudes, ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past, nor oppose other people' s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them.	5.988766557256176
They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing.	6.270015333427043
As an extra precaution, I am validating this advice to our scientific committee.	5.751352443998122
Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport.	5.5607786188902795
Mr President, first of all, I am pleased that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment: pollution, unsupervised fishing, drilling platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of widescale damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore, and fishing is also a victim of this situation.	5.272686464392842
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	0.6676733518247148
It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period.	5.617806200115018
I must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr Katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee.	4.8112683442891395
Some have different sectors and, in view of the volume of data to be sent, could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data, if the same deadlines are set.	4.79109344551313
We are also under an obligation to help because of another fact, the fact that Mozambique is one of the few African countries to have used democratic means to recover from the bloody civil war by which it was consumed for several years after it gained independence.	6.083159805007773
Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident.	3.9874797051812516
The Commission has done this in its five-year plan by listing one of the four priorities.	5.333798458779138
Our aim must therefore be to make this reactivation of the economy long-lasting with strong growth and job creation.	5.987782778732528
This debate, I think, has summed it up.	3.279845658675015
The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard.	5.400938450395355
As you may be aware, in contrast with the cold Northern seas, the Mediterranean is a small, warm sea where there are very few, if any, schools of only one species of fish.	5.544899884340046
(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.)	3.056493613278023
A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson.	3.456601587928822
It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes.	4.964780599113405
There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women.	4.131246598960073
Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion, what will be our response - more laissez faire or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn?	6.104034456424828
The Commission is also preparing a medium-term Community response combining NGO co-financing with European Development Fund operations to help Mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re-establishing the rapid pace of growth that Mozambique had worked so hard to achieve.	6.113952479989795
Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these.	5.79966699799076
The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this.	4.214803216426001
It points to the problems experienced in 1999, when, notwithstanding the problems, there was currency and price stability, increased employment, the beginnings of a period of upturn, and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment.	4.927402862419396
A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep.	4.270546998429705
Children have lost parents, families are bereft, hopeless, helpless and they have lost absolutely everything.	6.25457032748737
The President-in-Office informed our committee that the current Portuguese presidency intended the CFP to be regarded as a policy for ensuring the sustainability of our resources. This must be our objective in Europe and throughout the world.	4.911932083999024
I cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time.	4.155738191640818
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gallagher' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee. It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur.	4.553025009772601
And if Europe wants to be left behind, left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism, than yes, vote against this report tomorrow.	5.074940862099169
Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard.	6.429370769964462
The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event.	5.224203607125785
I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development.	4.6509269272587614
It can, nevertheless, in the affected fish, lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures.	6.523339550380365
I would like to emphasise, however, that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing.	4.148058536773485
Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks, but what I am really saying to you Commissioner, and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again: There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen.	5.412626520200265
Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money.	4.551087285053731
I think that the European Parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and churning out old political concepts and visions.	6.325491038297517
The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal.	4.794801465246355
These decisions must be defended by the Commission in ICCAT. This is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the European Parliament' s role.	5.748992349628489
They have all been persuaded!	2.3172830894004295
This is the only way to go forward, because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs.	4.275111369076485
In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes.	6.212895503339786
An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment.	5.792228408056515
I feel, however, that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level.	4.466146487366455
In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones. The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns.	5.342441985738307
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2).	2.07902310913768
There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk.	4.572871860144055
The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest.	6.527014692314227
Combating certain fish diseases	2.5211038437908173
The Mediterranean, particularly in some zones, is an extremely important spawning area for the bluefin tuna which is of enormous commercial value.	5.085701372786288
The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man' s activities.	6.14100445604414
The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message.	5.974324366202896
I discovered that the EU is using ERDF resources to finance the construction of a wharf in Vilagarcia, in Galicia, for storing chemical and hydrocarbon products, on a site which will only employ three workers. This contravenes the EC environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as Arousa, where 26 000 people earn a living from the seafood industry.	6.832611905199173
In addition to destroying natural resources, this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors, particularly those dependent on fisheries.	5.212675225427605
Finally, I would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the Treaty.	2.731476502343429
But beware of the backlash from the workers and the unemployed, who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but, on the contrary, are getting worse.	5.372923120448191
Not necessary!	-0.0
So this report, Mr President, provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease.	3.530606409799166
When I read the report and see the picture of the EU' s economy that is described there, I think it is quite a worrying picture.	4.216203897707008
These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit.	3.4519113074747563
The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form.	5.6671912172967485
Parliament' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets.	3.730960205233497
Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14, many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely.	5.189441906400543
The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not.	6.727126435723412
I do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy' s effectiveness which must therefore, in my opinion, be significantly improved.	4.200131282518146
This is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth' s sake.	5.237896174238199
I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee' s debate. These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks.	5.676477603602649
This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products.	5.90170993438256
Instead, you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States.	3.812112054104792
The debate is closed.	0.06428390924856775
All will be beneficial, not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required.	5.490596834206712
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	1.2463875053868512
Thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment, and only international solidarity can save them.	5.252428541809836
These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care, water and sanitation.	5.679868560343456
It does not replicate at temperatures above 25º centigrade and would, if present in fish for human consumption, be inactivated when ingested.	6.923359485337761
The Union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way, but without forgetting public investment.	4.399202057959054
We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years. It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy.	4.88454190094102
Rebuilding infrastructure is crucial, because otherwise there can be no development. It is also time for some creditor countries to think about writing off or reducing Mozambique' s debts.	5.90854253026884
The Council of Europe is coming before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 22 March to speak about the research work that must be undertaken, particularly in the marine environment and, more precisely, the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans.	4.153729755826138
I also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of Council Decision 90/424/EEC by specifically including ISA in its appended list of diseases, thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50% Commission, 50% Member State.	5.971113268955963
I also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are quickest and best in the various countries.	5.429954721669011
It is as simple as that.	2.883355509453298
I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler' s response, particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted.	5.277603315757106
These recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the Union' s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy, which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment.	4.914764158014864
A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet.	4.903937197525471
Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union.	4.685367219183709
I therefore support the Commission' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation.	4.819335429818163
We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds.	4.72862678787488
We talked about the importance of the Commission developing a series of headline goals for non-military actions related to crises and, if I may say so, if ever there was a case where that is relevant, it is the disaster which has overwhelmed Mozambique.	5.004042159566123
Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth.	4.303497101709443
The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries.	2.9662192540198102
I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward.	4.8462461928590805
However, the aid needed now is difficult to get through, despite the efforts of the NGOs, because the roads, bridges and railway lines are damaged.	4.547782650306375
It is clear that we must find a solution to this problem, either at the time of the Commission report on regional fisheries organisations or, if possible, before then.	4.177739197425744
We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory.	4.33878014460374
Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions.	6.048307187184792
As the President of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, remarked in a dramatic appeal, each passing day may mean death for many Mozambicans.	6.451827562574716
This report recommends radical measures, which in essence will make it easier to employ people.	5.388559687316387
Indeed, it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources.	4.726547458164328
Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments.	5.312327018189687
A quota management system such as that existing in New Zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative.	6.397512474797137
To the rapporteur' s regret, I must unfortunately point out that our Group cannot support Amendment No 3 because we consider that it restricts creditors' legal position and impairs their legal protection.	5.468448376846203
They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates.	4.525693389293023
About 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods, about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance.	5.112318879711717
This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s.	6.893226105911948
The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria. The same yardstick should be used for everyone.	5.765215130430495
To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations.	6.318532726019871
Anyway, we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more.	4.265305965233848
Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved.	5.974795758639863
If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets' suspicion of the euro.	5.978586560769597
With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person, this idea is clearly defined in Article 3.	5.215417816613449
The next item is the Commission statement on flooding in Mozambique.	2.7302887153582875
All laudable stuff.	2.3636972803406406
This is reasonable and we support this, but we have to ask the Commissioner, why not Africa?	3.697881271408124
We remain committed to eradicating the disease, an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon-farming sector.	5.280377061797261
A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation.	4.537980264676967
Mr President, Commissioner, Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy.	5.679044033925169
The Commission has, however, made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind.	4.112298558203351
The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes.	3.4991914283113785
This is a good thing, moreover, and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for.	4.573162522071277
The real world simply does not work like that.	4.324827793417801
However, Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans.	4.742330159977629
The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms, working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm.	6.538949782785365
These recommendations, which, for the most part, are consistent with the guidelines in the Portuguese presidency' s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the Lisbon Summit, have been rejected or distorted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament, by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a European Union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets.	4.10206810243792
We do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force: in short, we must make it possible to carry on a major, responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment.	5.10311046913695
The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one.	6.2748373225036715
The first is that data originating from studies and samples should be used as a source of data whose collection could otherwise be interminable. The second is that the requirement for data referring strictly to the taxation of enterprises should be removed from the Commission' s proposal, bearing in mind that this tax data does not come within the Community competence.	4.957345332633928
The alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks dwindle and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports.	6.829708675759816
Mr President, I think that this policy will engender not hope, but deep disappointment in European workers.	5.233980134583038
Mr President, I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created.	3.4912185439610584
Large-scale degassing proliferates and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution.	6.381662220186319
In February, Commission Regulation 394/2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued.	6.324425739760868
All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected.	4.437045444490115
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	0.9339162903881475
That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment.	3.8600596843662247
It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations.	3.8968993972480277
Mr President, the report presented by the Commission on the Union Economy in 1999 appears to us to be mostly utter waffle as it scarcely shows why our performance remains hopelessly below the potential that the immense human resources of Europe should allow.	6.227828148241464
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	0.954080703182541
The next item is the report (A5-0016/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the second report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the "statement of conclusions from the intermediate ministerial meeting on the integration of fisheries and environmental issues, 13-14 March in Bergen" (COM(1999) 270 - C5-0156/1999 - 1999/2150 (COS)).	4.20158616729936
) Mr President, I believe we totally agree with Mrs Attwooll' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals, intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector, come at a critical time.	4.546212180400691
However, more than a dozen large Belgian beam trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the UK fleet to do so.	6.41603331405353
I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves.	5.103362665077298
The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address.	5.6027696847067725
Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft, especially helicopters, of which it is clear that too few are in action.	5.562422215025546
I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry.	6.220509308910633
Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy.	2.9494508811015767
Yesterday, as some of you have noted, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe.	2.8155972965429488
If Mr Katiforis' s report had been approved in its initial wording, none of the members of the Committee on Fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being lynched.	5.386768346374958
As you all know, this convention was the result of many years of discussion, which was often difficult and often laborious, and that for this very reason, it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles, that is to say, the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our Member States.	4.889473286642158
In this respect, important Community initiatives arose from Bergen which have always been supported by our committee. These are aimed at re-establishing the breeding biomass, reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources, protecting juveniles, species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries.	6.036466736520823
Our Group categorically condemns this perception and, in this sense, does not intend to support this resolution.	3.8244521322527154
There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold.	5.1600001449314465
Bankruptcy procedures	-0.0
There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a large number of dead, a lack of food and drinking water, and homes and crops have been destroyed.	4.389646554561403
This also shows that our committee is in total agreement when it comes to supporting measures which aim to protect species, such as tuna in this case.	5.080513050827688
For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission.	3.004255048377096
We are able but the rest of the female population is not?	1.2819845881154421
The debate is closed.	0.09836995593801498
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps.	4.597407080184681
It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help.	3.896723360637921
It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves, we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy.	6.251631427212417
The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters.	5.889646951146267
With regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems, we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible, although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them, of course, as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make, and also in view of the fact that, in any case, satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels.	5.285300849859648
However, I will just remind you that the meeting in Bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created.	5.189079792870521
Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far.	4.388056551887274
They are having to choose, for example, between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit, but clearly avoiding any price rises, or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed, given the EU' s population growth.	5.388521091258902
The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS)).	3.5350213968316724
Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence.	6.421159804653633
The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet.	6.029323061131016
They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna, with temperate tuna, the north and temperate tuna south and other species.	6.920253405004534
The report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a European research area and the promotion in all countries of the Union of converging measures on research, lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the States in the field of taxation.	4.658133857119053
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism.	5.2282652537706324
However, the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission' s proposal.	4.730304026603265
These conditions are binding, however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period.	5.849301704313261
This integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general.	5.465644135174285
I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated.	3.8730682613396437
Finally, we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks, as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage.	4.39521712486663
Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament, accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group, I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience.	6.047144222200646
We currently believe that this improvement, which we highlighted in the perspectives in November, may lead to even better results than initially forecast.	5.567053853817404
The reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain, let alone eradicate ISA, and while failing to deliver its objectives, the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance.	6.210752709577113
Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first 'environmental' disaster, Minamata disease, occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury.	5.5566176604811
Let me turn to the assistance provided so far.	3.864425711994084
Maritime transport, industrial and urban pollution and waste also have negative effects on fisheries whose problems do not just come from overfishing.	5.646027105931826
Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said, the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking.	5.752014064642822
The debate is closed.	0.05327647657378663
We are, for example, still waiting for the proposal for a regulation on banning the import of bluefin tuna from Honduras and Belize. The recommendation for this dates from 1996.	4.789417314828339
The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past.	4.489360793801477
The debate is closed.	0.20890942421089717
Mr President, the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before.	3.82008422354416
We are pleased about this development, but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium-term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately. This should be done in conjunction with the Mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires.	5.175741118552751
I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way.	3.3799573624371697
We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence.	3.906624468831616
In Europe, in your rapporteur' s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly.	4.867823378779223
During the debate, a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation.	4.733638552473768
Mr President, Commissioner, no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry, particularly in view of the reform of the CFP in 2002.	3.9415737553641987
This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle.	3.3231295015338937
But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe, then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report, because it will deliver those jobs, and it will deliver those opportunities, and it is the only way to do so.	4.706491326444472
It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish.	4.0923804927384015
Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner?	4.730100262867841
Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries.	5.453644408418549
However, I must again congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher.	3.817192328155028
The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously.	5.023437779915791
The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission.	1.38248613204182
I am referring to this now because I will not have time to speak later on.	4.2018384435938
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report has the virtue of having brought life, debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions, although recognising its inability to put these into practice.	4.950054691471442
Secondly, it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in Community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries.	5.2001231611308425
This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future.	5.130635369757523
So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues.	3.5380805315398725
The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome.	4.139968196240422
The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean.	4.709525312981176
I would particularly draw my colleagues' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27º has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men.	5.338640239817349
The property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves.	4.87037049517175
You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease.	3.6898829642990503
When you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts, and the fact that we wish to improve coordination, I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed.	4.421851919624649
The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars.	5.56265306580643
In this light, I think that the European Parliament' s role will be limited in Lisbon, but also in the forum in June for which we might have an invitation, but are unsure as to the input we can have.	4.243457220398195
It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and, together with my colleague, Nol Mamre, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay, to the south of the 47th parallel north, because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches, particularly at the moment.	5.150588168477405
Furthermore, it was precisely for this reason, and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action, that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I asked him to join us, as soon as he returns, to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken, and those which we are going to take.	4.941917800897058
Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks.	6.115232634864137
The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments.	4.434500784858282
Bluefin tuna is the world' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and, of course, the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons.	6.1558148383928
The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done.	5.115482790914243
My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians, to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support.	4.56024784241724
It is important, of course, that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and, as stated by the rapporteur in her report, must be in compliance with international provisions.	4.2914127682259195
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report.	6.3492992711687135
I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions.	5.955284508318188
Both biological and economic information are included.	5.446819781903277
I agree, however, with the statement in Amendment No 2 saying that no compensation has been made payable to salmon farmers.	4.928598388065236
We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice.	4.907780613776295
As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy.	5.684564498302595
The second way is to recreate a law ex nihilo, that is to say, to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the Member States.	5.085892484137339
Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report.	3.353462442288393
Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent.	6.836136667201205
Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy.	3.680237602713199
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.	2.2227012382151803
Each day, each hour of delay costs many lives.	5.099162100442084
We have listened to the Commission' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation. This has simply left us with an image of an exasperating bureaucracy.	4.867184347188742
Floods in Mozambique	-0.0
It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment.	5.309064137505779
The women' s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light.	4.19181441909793
The WWF reports that, according to Italian, French and Spanish customs authorities, illegal bluefin fishing and landings of small fish are on the increase.	5.807467713772968
What is more, the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital, it is not European, but world-wide.	4.925657647530884
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness.	4.106512735768192
This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment.	3.8267563449319977
The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission, ECOFIN and the Central Bank, but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union.	5.153400293203065
The 1995 Convention, on the other hand, authorises the filing of secondary proceedings, thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted.	4.8497304598653495
Now, finally, the EU' s position is, of course, such that we can achieve high growth and seriously take up the fight against unemployment without jeopardising objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget.	4.559230592232749
It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message.	4.749706094341929
This particular communication from the Commission forms part of the Commission' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other Community policies.	4.48951365676796
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hudghton, also for this report.	3.2615348022246717
Without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control, damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity.	4.598769559555857
It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible, my dear Mr von Wogau, for the fall of the euro.	3.7373318586052258
We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future.	5.138261689767571
Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy.	4.220128259297842
The Commission feels, for this reason too, that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation, but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission' s opinions on the amendments under discussion.	4.817454250364979
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue.	5.237446104866742
Others, like Amendment No 4, which request financing for biological closures, also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force, although admittedly there is room for improvement in these.	5.484377543831933
So, yes, Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological, economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster.	4.853870812683607
Aquaculture should also be monitored.	3.271487018263483
Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems.	6.639845437545907
Mr President, fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment. Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions.	6.248656227829319
Now, as he said, in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually.	5.948047497553623
The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU, spread throughout some of Europe' s most peripheral communities.	5.9675296243904254
The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law.	4.811828314391482
With the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level, it will take 2,300 years to achieve a balance between men and women.	4.447142008124851
The next item is the report A5-0039/2000 by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Finland, with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on insolvency proceedings (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999 - 1999/0806(CNS)).	3.308135583974116
Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation.	6.220133146455703
High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting.	3.9744558105950913
The chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in Europe.	6.098787179723349
There is not one party, from the far left to the far right, which does not stress the need for women to take part.	4.149407253600261
Secondly, looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance.	3.4017470588543848
That is what the debate we are having is all about, on the subject of which I have this to say to you: we need more freedom and less state intervention.	3.926832463318854
It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April.	5.61356086522136
This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available.	4.263470043312545
Diseased fish should not remain in the farms and I am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment.	5.459235727325329
The Commission document too, which is being drafted for the summit in Lisbon, takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas.	5.601271986101802
In our opinion, the Union' s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity, not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs.	4.242870153742504
The EU and some of its Member States, including my own, have provided emergency financial aid, perhaps a little later than they should have, but they have done so, as have the United States and various countries in the region, particularly South Africa.	4.154911585891783
Mr President, this proposal aims to incorporate into Community law an ICCAT recommendation from 1998 which should have been binding from June 1999, but which only reached this House at the end of last year.	4.9748080036119955
I do not know what the metric equivalent is.	3.5445205003824807
I believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the Union where there is no alternative source of employment.	5.990693028322686
Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers, others will be incorporated into codes of practice.	5.360687521480925
Last week ECHO decided to allocate EUR 1 million for flood relief, of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the Spanish Red Cross and 150 000 through MSF Luxembourg, for operations in Mozambique and EUR 250 000 to Botswana through the German Red Cross.	6.832599199980247
Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising, first of all, the timing and the topicality of this debate on the devastating floods in Mozambique.	3.655092017469241
This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary.	5.50391477376277
I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation.	3.7082770669762914
I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes, even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met.	4.872534771429275
In this context, I can, in fact, see the EMU project' s main weakness, for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above.	4.6337101125776154
Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis.	6.565781914108896
Well, I do not agree with them but I think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information, and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it, then we will have bad decisions.	5.392261394563816
There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development.	3.445793244514456
The overall strategy of the Commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over-exploitation and/or environmental degradation.	6.802024962603362
Mr President, our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster, but good intentions are not enough, there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment.	5.059689066327025
Mozambique is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of Africa' s great success stories with its work on economic growth, on poverty reduction, on democracy in spite, of course, of massive debt pressures.	4.631574928895153
I believe that since we have gone that far and we are continuing along that path, which is the route of creating a collective procedure for regulating this type of legal standard in the European Union, we should bear in mind that it should not become the allegorical figure of the guillotine.	5.117420878077024
Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes.	3.6962058532395257
