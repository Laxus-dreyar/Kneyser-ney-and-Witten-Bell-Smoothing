Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life.	0.8851059224749492
I want, finally, to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees, I have no misgivings.	1.075665874187931
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.	1.0669621689114437
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?	0.6550165541431804
This concern, ladies and gentlemen, lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative, and I am willing to rewrite the text, if necessary, in order to make this message clearer yet.	0.9124382159290493
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes.	0.7145813467189682
On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.	0.73289271360146
We have to act now, before it is too late.	1.1349652850814336
An amendment was therefore made in the committee, but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form.	0.9692446375931218
If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required.	1.1417522645044498
We need to get into that conciliation position.	0.7073317112335564
You will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of, that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials, that 85% of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92% of all cars in the Netherlands are recycled.	0.952345607933758
We should also recognise that, in Europe, our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one.	0.9015752289343154
The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State.	0.8791829986937507
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges, in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.	1.031398770444496
We have to lay down the rules of play today, before we all lose.	0.9796444621088752
Two important questions have arisen in this regard. Yes, there are in fact more than two questions, but I want to mention just two of the most important.	1.1156615361163715
The previous speaker already said something about this.	0.6722462608357305
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.	0.7305463252423804
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.	0.9805259039142467
Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements.	0.8686528846077666
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions, for which Europe has an enormous responsibility.	1.1070487738338821
Are there any objections to this oral amendment?	0.5830639944848222
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context.	0.4046119397864368
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.	0.6650721100204359
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public.	0.9511612040350983
First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment.	0.8282681878131667
It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now.	1.1214985701074918
Even in this Chamber, the Council' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories.	1.0516965094511581
This is what intelligent restructuring is about.	0.693231071233538
The Austrian People' s Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.	1.0069243418761398
We must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which, as the rapporteur himself has underlined, now claims, after years of discussion, to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months.	1.111547447753086
In our view, the axes which could create a basis for its support are: the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector, the framing of a Community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market, coordination of the tourism policy with other, parallel Community policies which affect it directly or indirectly, a study of the sector, and the adoption of medium and long-term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product.	0.9596411995586711
Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report.	1.35686726940501
It is good that the procedure exists.	0.6203200800989614
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.	1.1268328472621123
We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union.	0.9034093231566391
This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights.	1.0677664858432117
That is the reality.	0.7781769495992054
In contrast with that, I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies, which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion.	1.0178229411799462
Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected.	1.2028887823956642
You know the French proverb, 'Nothing for nothing' .	0.6619389776747193
Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms.	0.45793995914662683
Does the Commission support the Council?	0.6646355321396441
For our part, we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area.	0.783456528475938
The Committee on Budgetary Control has even suggested postponing approval of the Brok report until the Council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7.	0.6311957117303699
If it is not adopted, Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past.	1.0667245356246724
My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal, namely China.	0.9501805120144117
I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work.	0.7970176670171574
Including Jörg Haider' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries.	0.8570336424893358
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi, Vice-President Kinnock, Mr Reding and myself.	0.6484811548829015
Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.	0.7612039243783623
Statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various Member States who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments.	0.7228025871627148
We need to cooperate with the Council too.	1.0102761498032593
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive.	0.7467062087125823
The main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system.	1.112576777689646
Yet, the sum of EUR 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999, was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in Kosovo, especially where the provision of health services is concerned.	0.8680542324011113
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.	0.4951450502789351
I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen.	1.1304054216507773
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential.	0.8501664847442885
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here?	0.86490229571739
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.	1.0827355105456298
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control.	0.7140587388836908
The Commission' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts.	1.0114866583626396
Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.	1.011193125641125
On the basis of a report, the human rights organisation Global Witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of Dos Santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts.	0.851965804346278
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	0.7622463104446721
This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels.	0.6310094606029517
Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.	0.9232394923181908
I very much agree with you on that, but we can take nothing for granted.	1.1322827756876028
Commissioner, it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe, men and women, are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations.	1.1352691734949274
Since we are recovering from a very complex crisis, we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance.	0.7149660028435401
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement.	0.7262700055839452
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested.	0.5787466973344211
When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way.	0.8192901572061155
There is another small step, which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia.	0.7134887748319795
The FPÖ party is established in Austria' s political landscape.	0.7078654137598637
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded.	0.6052331823577524
He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers.	0.8399974668094178
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament, and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance, can be solved.	1.136501390777348
In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America, I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement, we will be there to pay for it.	1.0411716069656334
However, an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession, one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States, nonetheless, find too offensive.	0.9204234618372955
My reply would be: a new start, a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously.	0.8935848690721058
Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements. For example, the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings.	0.8324559574004932
Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe.	1.3098780661288525
Madam President, I asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as President of this House. We have a procedure for visits to be made to this House to report on certain situations.	1.1589990838001427
However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary.	1.3104490367091586
The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively.	0.962303175576992
Where is the beef?	0.21094886433156912
Furthermore, Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive' s area of applicability.	0.6966821810395696
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra.	0.5281749700308841
More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate, regardless of its population.	0.6609116195665194
. I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote.	0.9533986402422705
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.8299669303292925
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.	0.8372186426459038
Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the "founding" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6.	1.0066418038452782
This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm.	0.4460788720551147
This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo.	0.6102694108669522
Mr President, how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola?	0.8234558597546036
The government of the United States, or of Israel?	1.032712923318592
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses, coaches and other vehicles, so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.	0.7746383122954816
The debate is closed.	0.05313930884534361
I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy.	0.7221380320291688
From that standpoint, it is useful that the Commission' s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly, the activities of the structural funds.	1.1804835342527535
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament.	1.2486191886297917
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.	0.5012964666853005
A new independent audit system service must be set up.	0.7275877407673299
It can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles.	0.6331081636370952
In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats.	0.9438560316518215
In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level.	0.631370833536289
I make no apology for this approach; I firmly believe that it is the correct one.	0.8925947104229958
There are still, needless to say, many unresolved problems and unanswered questions, also involving the Palestinians.	0.7492426014397578
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems.	0.5478208951957669
Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities, groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming.	0.799499005337874
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council, and in the end, makes it rather irrelevant.	1.0244021866109811
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one, as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens.	0.9317745793950588
This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, that this letter is still valid. I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies.	0.9151075970452154
co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Mr President, I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning, but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about.	1.1163160539023358
Of course, the story of the Erika seems comical.	0.9328500506616313
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place.	0.8371822687891405
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.	1.2427919277063388
I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries.	0.7141409150963315
In this second report, the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office, since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members.	0.9834362532750175
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve, particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes.	1.0906572591633585
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.18298199248737837
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities.	0.9592206106658752
Here we must ensure that the good schemes, those which are really excellent, are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work.	0.9699123728853217
I also want to take up the subject of migration.	0.7777184372918907
Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika sank near my home and is still there, with 20 000 tonnes in its hold, the fate of which we are waiting to discover.	0.9824299030827418
But there are some who bear even more responsibility than the thugs who wielded the iron bars and knives: those who spread racist and xenophobic slander, those who indulge in anti-immigration demagoguery in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, sometimes even here in this House, are no better than those who take this stupid, reactionary demagoguery at face value.	0.748442945101173
The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame.	0.36329717692758556
That concludes the vote	0.3388654807950775
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals.	0.6325446651057842
Mr President, on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues. This time, however, I actually agree with her.	1.222543450413796
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, "Never again!"	0.82095864134482
Another example is cacao.	0.3101510976002527
It is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in Geneva.	1.0071355533695165
We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed.	1.1063261676223797
In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse.	1.0172883501872931
Then, by gearing actions to micro-projects and making them accessible to the civil society in the southern countries and, finally, by calling for enlargement and the rapid accession of Cuba, which all the ACP called for at Nassau and which has now made a formal application.	1.0589308442667402
However, please learn from the events of Seattle: we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade, on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend, on the other.	1.0770886885209061
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis.	0.46475603848905317
These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts, without any control whatsoever.	1.0158426820868411
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in, this is the one that counts in their eyes.	1.337833988750231
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m.)	0.38375576359431995
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing.	0.822056147646084
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility.	0.6889283765101689
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework.	0.9430116939773847
There have only been nine rejections.	0.4447862004044301
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.	0.7143992991068804
Regarding the fight against organised crime, 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the Vienna action plan, which resulted in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associations, in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the Member States for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering. And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group.	1.0194817185906384
I ask for your support.	0.5137838532170954
Unfortunately, very little.	0.9169144818285078
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here!	0.9052395494197776
We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.	0.5334079592218516
I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio, and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection.	1.1093025582323883
On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed.	1.1446104259805567
After a month, however, there was still only a handful of observers.	0.7403703809194586
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.	0.9308064693807367
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production?	0.9102590564618915
In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world.	1.2544213326756175
Since 1991, the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.	1.062932404690894
Madam President, I should like to leave it here. As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft, the Commission will await the vote and will, based on this, determine its stance.	1.2086286583452972
Given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in OTC instruments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and parts of Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45 which pertain to OTC instruments.	0.8131652588107141

Your question switched to the subject of arms, a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will, of course, address in the future, if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context.	1.0150871655532756

I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date.	0.8795837898949868

At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now.	0.4427797057107957
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals.	0.9445598817066444
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	0.6128684922475148

I expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation.	0.8180123540608224

But if the Tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency, then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market.	0.901444472660308

I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage.	0.7671581297561789
I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment.	1.0374034087863588
From this vantage point, there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy.	0.8543523948677985

However, I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State.	0.9397001573848006
The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental.	0.9677854973040678

That is lacking in this new system, or at least is only there in embryonic form.	0.808218493668735
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter.	1.1351179055323515
The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member.	1.003596043791959

Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined.	0.9215244540098033

I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria!	0.9178527430436269

Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world.	0.8869881091169152
All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8764729918764091

This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.	0.7469818079543629
Madam President, the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair.	0.6873906000541085

Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear, which, in turn, will result in a stock market and economic crisis.	0.7890316495011309
In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State.	0.8628524369865564

I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well.	0.9940598679514235

Question Time (Commission)	0.315520918328718
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities, such as the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament, which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU.	1.0281563830832618
The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable.	1.3099194380636079

Are we doing enough?	0.591470930792048
That, in my judgement, is the challenge for the next few weeks.	1.4564603267884166
Allow me, however, to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of Europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered, what options there are available, how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings, savers' demand for security, and the opportunities Europe' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age.	0.8836687840812435
This has since been unanimously approved.	0.5184204602924196
You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice.	1.185116111267987
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996.	1.022687989954424
Europe, Japan and the US - the euro, the yen and the dollar, would constitute, in my opinion, such a block.	1.0088157991811435
Certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations, in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure, which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.	1.0081984388846488
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith.	0.746992147487183
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution.	1.0182492543385662
And I should point out that, for the first time in history, a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago.	1.0174203657670722
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did.	1.196105599648928
Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible.	0.9615072941454202
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who asked me about this, that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions, the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.	0.9146254266171479
While, basically, I subscribe to the European Commission proposals, nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion.	1.1674679107655725

Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced.	1.1677962064886187
As a political force, we serve to guarantee that Austria will continue to embrace European values.	0.9980012264403213
That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted.	0.6433831479836699
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East.	0.8142923900860906
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning.	0.7014221820806147
If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid.	1.0536244639374863
The new Europe should not only expand horizontally, but also vertically, by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community.	0.9192791206761568
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation.	0.2969973878036391
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission.	0.8519342425969134
According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF.	1.0235877109465676
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.	1.2033483220557346
Subject: Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions, and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on, in terms of either finance, entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities, living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line, what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment?	0.794627487349957
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States.	0.6663842391454973
Certainly not!	-0.0
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.	0.8732154845991573
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes.	0.8168903179684327
The point is: does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions?	0.9250742922605278
My second question concerns the burden of proof.	0.46841734520894307
The fundamental question, it seems to me, that faces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is: What is Europe?	1.255764407961769
Even today, surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China' s Communist Party.	0.5948425602678739
We want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up trying to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument.	1.206667178606146
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.	0.8660190670565425
In particular, we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area, as I am certain that one of the Union' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order. It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation, bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based, and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries, particularly in this context.	1.0661729758923117
If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate.	0.7609671988027582
Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings, but also protection against copying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary, and protection against any other form of production.	0.8171642541753138
It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community.	0.9383022167498036
Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.	1.1293697443400832
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.	0.589053567053271
Like other Arab countries before them, the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations.	0.7198678127632379
Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down.	0.9254668091266007
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union.	1.026762608683883
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected.	0.9745638361617075
In fact, it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport.	0.7207572471260784
A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives.	0.9660632957218545
In other words, to put it simply, Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.	0.9156279959248139
We have set minimum requirements at European level, which all Member States and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses, especially when they are massive, or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers.	1.053206845717658
However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives?	0.9875936137116241
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union, resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste.	0.7042623774647754
Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way?	1.1968123774186339
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties.	0.7819634900987562
This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it, which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision.	1.0817372308416964
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK.	0.8253199547787169
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.	0.41142494406892094
Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new.	0.7870877198673194
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.	1.142168877961635
So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing - and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region - I am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority.	1.1303267256392266
The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation, boosting equality of opportunity, increasing the sustainability of employment and development, are only mentioned in passing.	0.8472409327071057
These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer' s liability and the requirement for recycling.	0.7277387119784061
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter, for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate.	0.8586067495651637
Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently.	0.7711313093429675
It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes.	0.8202709577321043
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative, and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today.	1.0327198380570395
One example is the use of peat.	0.633827336823225
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.	1.1624191750035033
I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance.	1.0346179029535567
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?	0.5502855585800652
Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside.	0.7924119787947642
We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values.	1.1192565188905872
(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)	0.48686597138281473
The debate is closed.	0.1850697101387827
So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address.	1.2064389690317263
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles.	0.6017955776709386
In 1999, the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs, which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council.	0.9032111028131634
Mr President, for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.	1.1242290705285944
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be.	0.8252655352243202
But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you?	0.7217900651247096
A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter, but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists.	0.8314880479100369
Mr President, the Commission's proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the Commission and the fact that the new Commission needs to re-examine the issues involved.	0.9203301024988827
Through the current programme, which covers the period 1997 to 2000, we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender-specific needs are taken into consideration.	0.884904891451749
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively.	1.1038916769763247
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament, the Council or the Commission.	1.0303808498666727
In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.	1.0433252188369446
Nevertheless, given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction, this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion.	1.053665806453926
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.	0.8491890895369272
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem.	0.8868008340627725
Postal services must continue to be public services.	0.5816926119633904
This is not covered by the directive.	0.9947662334124933
Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union' s main objective - enlargement - because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter?	1.0476175453596588
In short, to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements.	0.7046221683986922
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon, in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament, in which the assistants were informed of this.	1.0437612657525213
We must do this for the sake of the environment.	0.8123312167470267
Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives.	0.9060131985889095
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale.	0.669904454945812
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.	1.0921315533391094
I therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.5294061977148594
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas, hops, cows and Indian hemp.	0.7200977072720252
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates.	0.9226439367632173
I hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the Tampere Agreements on immigration and the new Spanish Act on aliens. In particular they must ensure that people arriving in Europe do not lose their dignity.	0.9056513993962518
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.38346402911130756
May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference.	0.8242825329335444
Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse.	0.8386867270648813
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.	0.9250139755887727
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities, as they do not have enough resources.	1.1082402421138453
I do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies, unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced.	0.6377110048545221
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion.	0.6078962168689104
Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views.	1.0621150937402168
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.	0.7120818124936457
This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it.	0.8161373844635524
As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat.	0.6961693340414163
I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first.	1.18201879336001
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction.	0.8581831072968547
Mr President, may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work.	0.6767206420678534
However, I remind this House that, back in June 1997, a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy.	1.1623794126831368
The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.	0.9196818099725854
You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.	1.0499465363644958
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union' s rural development policy.	0.9528771306836931
I understand that Portugal is affected by this.	0.6355700428856361
Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account.	0.9797665496300425
Finally, Mr Prodi' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence.	0.8890951620367468
This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27.	1.0378240405970747
Before the vote	-0.0
We thank you for that.	0.6963750277123629
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this?	0.6930863672492323
We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans.	0.9189966987407846
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.	0.5796323083934105
There too, of course, outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees.	0.6087994893786335
Commissioner, this morning President Prodi, among others, stressed that the Balkans are testing our ability to act effectively, the very credibility of the European Union is on trial, and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed.	1.0726481491878224
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms.	0.8650846664168378
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament.	0.7582067463809187
As far as we, the Council presidency, are concerned, we will continue to follow these developments very closely, and we will certainly cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative on this matter.	1.147494888952003
As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches, the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules, which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner, with this disparate agenda, with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation.	1.2345147691712692
For the time being, please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin.	0.8908099524132143
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade.	1.0344087672875741
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation.	0.8534066485700954
These splendid cars do not constitute waste.	0.27185947462091525
Report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD))	0.7212511201008794
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.	1.0388513712240153
These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field: food must be of the same standard in all Member States.	0.918826114697231
It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity.	0.7205151482881035
When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.	0.6660710231218533
In fact we need more emotional statements to remind us that all these issues have a human side.	1.0239590338201288
What should we do with the shredded products?	0.586289568574658
I admit that, at present, the matter seems to be somewhat confused.	1.078181730470314
During the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw Parliament actively involved, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta - it was understood that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision. On the one hand, certain points which the Council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and, on the other, the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely.	1.0309947921839002
It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.	0.8073979743735384
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.	1.0231159108564007
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation.	0.9147528758894791
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us, after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings, finally to produce a joint resolution.	0.9131857174786187
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions.	0.7293357338187576
Thank you for a very clear answer, the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements.	1.1060588138569236
For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence.	1.0116341812437832
We have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other, despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the Commission and Parliament.	0.9107559380853586
Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner.	1.1205571954119828
It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted.	1.0252867731232669
Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.	0.871437158670363
By accepting Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrating that our Europe is not involved in the shameful process of 'playing but not paying' , and that, when we get indignant about absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences.	0.8487224441534715
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member, since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission.	0.8565743073004617
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.	0.5099739647311724
Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater.	0.557945832247626
The Commission' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets (so-called OTC derivatives).	0.5188560273048192
The next item is the joint debate on:	0.5426463971616102
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work.	1.1386409219864797
Therefore, and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne, I reject your choice of legal basis.	0.9277380170381915
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.	0.3152260908874803
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence.	0.9876004012136459
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis?	0.7104524960087474
In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally.	0.6575705718817483
These are my three questions.	0.39236780945517025
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution.	0.8633704328555454
The ACP countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion.	0.7689066944207305
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot.	0.9990189506768175
Will current programmes continue to be implemented?	0.8139470185527818
The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future.	0.9749697041362677
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.	0.5809348734444879
We all agree on this.	0.5617476172160651
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.	1.2305999555363678
And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.	1.1794674810889956
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today, the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way.	1.1174776822791783
That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation.	1.0913343011064913
Another factor is that the world market is growing explosively.	0.8757283720675071
So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting.	1.0169700284337222
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular.	0.6619918582198294
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink, and we shall therefore do two things: we are, and will continue to be, fully committed to internal reform, and we shall rethink our policies in detail.	1.2746556185583118
Nevertheless, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions, when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately, different considerations must be taken into account.	0.9495358287867467
Not to use women' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste.	0.8064685306415584
It must be seen to deliver.	0.853335257905047
But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company' s decision.	0.7398954471982221
Because, when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces, failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation.	0.689845923642953
The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small.	0.6728310686444678
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles.	0.5171780873307517
The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote.	0.9899574399375898
Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.	0.9147337891575058
Modern criminal law revolves around the quest for a balance, a dialogue between security and freedom.	0.6898635872567144
Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and, in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Berger.	1.071518177973978
We are all immigrants.	1.028636986069483
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June.	0.5994741218191502
We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny.	0.8827582898816021
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.	1.1513701381745902
Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems: high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment, poverty and social exclusion.	0.7171803079790269
It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion.	0.9794958475331637
It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important.	1.132065671474872
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?	0.41506370402117043
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors.	0.8487944314468864
There is a possibility, which has not yet been absolutely confirmed, that continuous and direct discussions may take place, with work continuing until September this year.	1.0142694817949078
A drop in standards should not be allowed.	0.5894907464555231
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities.	0.6294903196299522
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	0.8598700605531354
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear, but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action.	0.8665566373584226
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice.	0.9568202568909239
Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG!	0.7665822776390663
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who, in a short space of time, has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today.	0.9039269962308603
Directive 70/524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not accord genetically-modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur.	0.8242370969045034
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.	0.6562295859730025
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement.	0.5237461711317741
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved.	0.670032725701015
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time.	1.1640303654084065
Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies?	0.6064339721577723
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.	0.9602790436150074
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.	1.2931528318559944
It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty.	1.0886950420643593
This is a responsibility that the European Union takes very seriously, Mr Posselt, and I would like to mention that, at the General Affairs Council held on Monday, this issue was repeatedly stressed when we were discussing Kosovo.	1.1880068275745344
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy.	0.8316627217802528
Finally, and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House, particularly yourself, Mrs Schroedter, in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies, for development or redevelopment, which, of all the priorities, offer the maximum opportunity to synergy, to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership. You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership, yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines.	1.1098913668756558
Chancellor Schüssel' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima.	0.6203290353303954
I have for many years, in word and deed, been committed to the anti-fascist struggle and the struggles for equal rights and against xenophobia. However, recent events - firstly, what were really threats by the Council of Ministers, then Mr Prodi' s threats against the Austrian Commissioner and, finally, the present decision - are things I cannot support.	0.8535529640574633
This latter point is of particular importance.	0.518621961753158
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level.	0.9904364340423353
With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication.	1.0712427538347007
If the world' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax, the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas.	0.8678416783464004
In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional.	1.0231200345059934
We await a proper response from the Russians.	0.376758647702637
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done.	0.9060454719936019
Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed.	1.0112148638792082
Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility.	0.5455037911743312
Graefe zu Baringdorf (A5-0015/2000)	0.31942978622353
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges.	0.6261173015880556
In addition, it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created.	0.9530972346908311
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions, to whit in 1992, in 1995 and 1997.	0.8463379130305971
The Commission will also support the presidency' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering, an eminently cross-pillar issue.	0.9226348508201633
As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.	0.8850254183702483
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies.	0.5496800550604974
At the end of August 1999, I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million, or ITL 4 000 billion, should go towards eliminating or, at any rate, reducing smoking.	1.0274648780369264
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation, the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions, particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe.	0.9869305606721993
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee.	1.1415447728432497
Furthermore - since we are in this European Parliament - if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union, how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level?	1.1345226808041544
All of this needs to happen, and quickly too.	0.9676654642011229
Even in that respect, any cooperation should, however, be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle.	0.7922541821425183
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments.	0.8051565209093426
I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined.	0.8843556838982342
Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.	0.4600888095815955
In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively.	0.792882593335907
So, unification in this small area.	0.4352062313228395
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because, in the end, we did not manage to adopt a review clause.	0.9652424855137888
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea.	0.678889371746866
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached, with great difficulty, with the Council in December, according to which, when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction, the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary.	1.1948891385866274
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress.	1.0220103169840742
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible.	0.8659515398202711
The unions will have something to say as will industry.	0.6535199626935787
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise.	0.6875465917172335
The basic aim of the communication is twofold.	0.7082618458458452
We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators.	0.9647878418324765
One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding.	1.0692013902755753
Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report.	1.0093019214615755
There need to be tough rules stating, among other things, what may be decentralised, what may be outsourced and what is independent.	0.813773536822761
I have one observation, not a criticism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy.	1.2298482985174677
(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen (all the more welcome for being so few in number), one might have thought that it was an unimportant subject which was to be discussed at this hour, but that is not the case.	0.9111316294775181
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me.	0.9904081142254556
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report, they are a step in the right direction.	0.6868766453788322
We need to look very carefully at those.	0.8001376673798313
On East Timor, Mr Da Costa, from the Timorese National Resistance Council, gave a very moving address indicating that East Timor would also like to join the ACP when it becomes a state with a government.	0.8369642592106976
We must, some time soon, find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously.	0.8049152657671433
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily.	1.0774338776779633
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question.	1.1425746577233735
If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future.	0.5809655206450495
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.	1.1515879028586404
In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today.	0.8844130112641209
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina.	0.4726012748083516
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.	1.2933773586603434
Given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well-informed about developments in the common agricultural policy.	0.9670001799795042
I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted.	0.849065052582387
Mr President, acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of Europe.	0.5397333821218018
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.17287471616594752
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds.	0.7602840345591279
Mr President, I would like to offer a few explanations.	0.8063089945713062
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.18519949891055335
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement.	0.9358689168713775
Ireland, for generations, sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world, but now when the Celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations, we are showing a very ugly side to our character. Racism in Ireland is endemic.	0.6745514423461503
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe, on the contrary.	1.0698696480638965
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States.	0.8272337872742173
This requires anticipation, timely preparation and careful management of these processes.	0.671797599017602
We should not be so politically partisan.	0.9352425255793283
This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions.	0.9638404557459285
We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises, which I hope will not be the case, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome.	1.2777591795266963
The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)].	0.6509184694912069
First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.	1.0821109165410137
This is something to which we all want to contribute.	1.210357991807278
Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard. Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a regular basis, the list and the amounts that other donors contribute.	1.359235604103489
This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure.	0.8269199066309468
Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all.	1.0695855720837228
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies.	1.0088691573192177
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling.	0.9076891141546607
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up.	0.6570325846757122
Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice.	0.33686410056758864
Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature.	0.7402419186891757
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010.	0.8167174804372404
Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income.	0.9040798571372661
Yes, I am in favour of such a tax, but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow.	1.2381322094796927
We have asset inflation of global proportions.	0.28579544199870177
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves.	0.7755633575346785

No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information.	0.8642335817355399
We also know that many of them only earn EUR 30 a month, while their fellow European citizens can earn three times that.	0.659829584278649
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.	0.8965874843745965
On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us.	0.6301151060821828
It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged.	0.954902980059003
Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia.	0.8903778545714491
As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day.	1.0101201080020517
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken.	0.8056635467934751
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	1.0804813849216681
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform.	1.001016289605118
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998?	0.8066905447775312
The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation.	0.5778749405118102
As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety.	0.9075338283018894

The European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki, so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion, including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests.	1.0949709721780216
I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up.	0.9190229046774083
That should be our task, not political posturing.	0.98366894024399
It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further.	0.7087142552935454

I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin.	1.1199963535429562
We should not overlook this fact: postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels.	0.7288080366602682
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats.	0.7827116254464173
We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe.	0.8438262009669913
The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage.	0.9857566514450281

The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives.	0.7122257079039453
But we must look always to subsidiarity.	0.8192421097487853
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme, the presidency believes that it is worthwhile, bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty, to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention.	1.0907173237608556
I salute Mr Schmidt.	0.23351946522068978
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.	0.9836645695212295
In its present form, what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established credibility in this particular field.	1.0576879029144988
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem.	0.7364764999134377
That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments, even if it goes against their interests.	1.0046579158472528
Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place.	1.1260558287838274

Following the attack in Hadera on Monday, we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism.	0.7224824518542933
For this reason, and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing, I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship, for legality and, ultimately, for democracy itself.	1.1108898363635644

Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament.	0.45986378194594557
In 1999, Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission, echoing the Portuguese Presidency' s statement today, sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions, and in particular Eurojust.	0.8945512217615834
However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing.	1.2630437037021434
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by thanking Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme.	0.8985813693170259

The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform.	1.0396002338888353
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns.	0.29298747670284786
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation.	0.9562350327727241
As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money.	0.6389808072600867
We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects. We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established.	0.9527720167484061
Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal, the idea, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste, that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution.	1.2172145559470138
The rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing Cyprus and Malta under category 7.	0.7708510106655564
And, finally, I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we, as consumers, are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and, at the same time, obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which, I believe, there is broad agreement.	0.9182246723373588
After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas.	0.7589062259084403
I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention.	0.8779154801858734
This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.	1.137302506151203
The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations.	1.0011568359511285
Mr President, the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century.	0.9120699691193183
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission.	1.140309139478239

In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement and European defence.	1.064576137203357
On the contrary, it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when Cyprus joins the European Union and prepares for a turning point in its history.	1.0623993781840042
Madam President, we are debating an extremely serious issue.	1.0730690333266535
Finally, I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges, emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but, at the same time, be set a target, namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero.	1.0005708603148675
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.	0.5252262077582166

In any event, speaking now as a Greek, I want to tell some of the speakers I listened to earlier that much of what was said is fixated on other times and places.	0.7020457956979603
So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better.	1.0258148501518074
There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented.	0.6432815709976258
These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly.	0.9544440546039158
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted.	0.815766389140167

I thank the President-in-Office but I do not agree with him that the purpose of NATO' s intervention was to stop a humanitarian disaster, because we have a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo today, we have the hell of Milosevic, followed by the hell of the KLA and the NATO forces.	0.9043585551996934
We meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others, because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time.	0.8867842909802446
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings, at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points.	0.5888663020159272

Please support the Austrian people against this government!	0.6088165703343268
We have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text, in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which the Member States failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to Article 2(7) into the draft resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty.	0.9677225167776763
That proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive, gradual evolution.	1.1394079278412579

I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy.	1.0647998358870165
Sixthly and lastly, I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions, namely the legal privilege of company lawyers.	1.1424556787891258
Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor.	1.0377293433299615
I would like to present the Commission' s conclusion to you without any further ado: it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and, therefore, with ratification by this Parliament.	0.9097126133604456
Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars, although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy.	1.0336816076101427
Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them.	0.7399723074281023
On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying.	1.138836095783861
We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies.	1.0702017352465059
When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.	0.5948682473529894

What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?	0.738163414033436
Finally, following on from what was agreed in Tampere, the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor. This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino' s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role, which everyone considers vital.	1.2214587246153967
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food security, fisheries and immigration.	0.881580107318261
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	0.6236034369539454

I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields.	0.848016231076238
Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.	1.15110874480254
You see, the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport, its reduced cost, and competition from new centres of tourism outside Europe.	1.0016670337592974
Also, ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these.	0.6096824463075367
This will therefore be our rule.	0.7216883275330872
Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.	1.113655035233772
Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies.	0.9150609821239568
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security.	0.8356792267841867

Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000)	0.34581491594755476
We are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising Mr Kouchner' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in Kosovo, especially as regards judicial structures and police cover.	0.7918017863945466
One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments.	1.065119061613341
Questions to Mr Barnier	0.43267042207183337
Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community' s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on.	0.9441788453300298
We do need to obtain, from the Commission and the Council, in other words from each of the governments forming the Union, a clear, positive or negative, political stance. They must indicate whether they are ready to defend, within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance, the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system.	1.1624073122425327
The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious.	0.8683624910100481
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.	0.7549551656400475
This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9.	0.8663854349912704
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.	1.0486272287185316
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?	0.8554823597506547
In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining.	0.784338405812926
Do not continue in this vein!	0.5447450763096264
This declaration - which, as I have said, implicates the European Parliament, although no such declaration was put before this Parliament - is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation.	1.0522665433427898
Finally, just one more brief comment, Mr Byrne.	1.1399825420734775

This request, however, was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year. In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation.	0.8640735757805892
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be.	1.4277943251652274
It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations.	1.0534855211409093
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union.	0.6860509934385883
Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties.	1.0275751875614128
This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parité, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman.	0.9024548097968865
A period of ten years, as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26, among others, is, on the other hand, too short.	0.9901601103376168

We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union.	0.7545703795256481
At a forthcoming review of these programmes, it ought to be established that the EU' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU.	0.9366456473079547
This is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates, financed by the European Union, the CSF.	0.8136406004605757
Fortunately, the Italian Government and the President of the Republic intervened, and today the Italian Ambassador to Germany will also speak on the subject, to call on the German Chancellor not to interfere in Italian internal affairs, in so far as there are no neo-fascist candidates for government office.	1.0595846430997216
Secondly, we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because, in the final analysis, this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse.	1.0294895750686817

Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union.	0.6856910322004286
I would also like to stress, as many Members have highlighted, that human rights policy is at the heart of Europe' s identity and that respect for human rights should be seen as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the European Union.	1.0731356595353576
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.	1.0845043223949862
Nevertheless, I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy, and in particular the audiovisual dimension, the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe' s main fears.	0.7508345768987215

Hitherto this has been out of the question of course.	0.8115487840886062
Firstly, there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that.	0.8173874750157443

Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption.	0.9801051424281764
Mr President, today' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe.	0.8879796291762395
This will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer' s freedom of choice.	0.7389822261356995
This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles.	0.7523265186273694

Obviously, this inhibits competition and innovation and restricts the public' s range of savings options.	0.6141558137671128
These are the three most important aims of the directive.	0.9347253290672248
We also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure.	0.8731577256308796
Capital tax	-0.0
One of the reasons for the Community' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market, which explains its attractiveness for women and young people, to whom it often offers their first experience of employment.	0.9954747179360508
It is an important Community initiative which, together with the three other initiatives, URBAN, LEADER and INTERREG, is financed out of the Structural Funds.	1.041054655786318
Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping, otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed.	0.6708264042286681
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict, tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective.	0.8559415214841327

We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring.	0.6863115289644305
We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned.	0.9186585701106293
From here on things are going to be easier.	0.7875697059679453
Moreover, it was this situation and this interpretation which led the Council to take the decision it took in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, when it decided to take the first steps in the accession process for the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union.	1.1576439271765868
In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services.	0.8170965615783318
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system.	0.4437428544027074
Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say.	0.7082738829018885
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage.	0.9467365939274023
Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council.	1.0743889720448303
The environment is in a parlous state.	0.9043593383310834
This spurs us to maintain that the European Parliament would have done sterling work in guaranteeing that civil rights and freedoms were safeguarded, if this were a lawmaking parliament and if we were, as part of this procedure, in fact co-legislators - which we are not.	1.236250084486409
Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping.	0.7744711440102022
I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people.	1.286021645684916
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for.	0.7183052283746572
I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People' s Democratic Republic of China.	0.9670481835222758
I can only say very briefly, that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations, they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities.	0.9477435001487157

The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national, regional and local government.	0.6561751880016914
As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.	1.1274071041506775
To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved.	1.1393436999118232
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work.	1.2043313034343222
We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime.	0.7476276784480862
I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.	1.1018747805268407
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union.	0.7355110754667126
You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee.	1.2450049038179931
The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament.	0.8700138133438677
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more.	0.8390322181640141
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail.	1.0771598118463883
The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character, accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others.	0.6893579079650646
I would also like to thank Mrs Terrón i Cusí for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, and to thank all the Members who, in their various committees, have actively participated in preparing this annual debate. I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society.	0.963850312628929
On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that Turkey' s application for membership of the European Union may lead to greater flexibility in Ankara' s position on this.	1.0220122464674788
We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals.	0.7154602315467945
The words 'issued by' also need to be added after the words 'transferable securities' .	0.8092907951863673
Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status.	0.48850196067172746
As candidate countries of the European Union, they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning, that is to say as of now.	0.877471463576095
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there.	0.6267959523747919
Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.	1.1453638225240506
We can submit motions for this together with you.	0.3953228675197941
As such, I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described.	0.9373375389601657
I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology.	0.7787221946428643
As I have already said on a number of occasions, I am in favour - the Commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect, on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process, the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law, rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator.	1.1810683035124232
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.	0.9230110031194381
Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.	1.091415919722078
This is a complete revolution of the Commission' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking.	0.9024601302480136
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied.	0.7800817172200587
My third criticism stems from the first two. The weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations, a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus.	0.845371900104232
Europe must be modernised, made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies.	0.8593284894798514
We must create a cross-border culture, and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State, in each region and each municipality.	0.918262309973425
That statement could not be much clearer.	0.5656925395221561
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people.	0.7250020533455187
The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright, and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights.	0.7528548705987689
Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.	1.0492061448805878
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field.	0.8600323585527976
Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail.	0.7748914002371258
Mr President, as well as discrediting the PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna and the democratic government of the Basque Country - who have the kind of attitude which, in the case of Ireland, deserved the Nobel prize - by calling them Nazis, the declaration insults representatives of the European citizens - as in my case: I represent a section of Galician society - by saying that we are more dangerous than the Nazis, and insults groups which are clearly democratic, with decades of history, in an unacceptable and crazy way, which I would like to condemn here and now.	1.0738723150293648
We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union.	0.8230390353431877
This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse.	0.8320130405552787
At the same time, however, we shut our eyes to the Union' s own problems: to the violence, inequality, and fourth world reality, which is part of everyday life in the EU.	0.9302508512379675
There can be no democracy without a living parliament.	0.4876028995892107
While only around 10% of the world' s population live in sub-Saharan Africa, 70% of all people who became infected with the AIDS virus in 1998 live there.	0.8592684242861712
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission, I must tell you that I have received, pursuant to Rule 37, seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate.	1.0533983626570134
The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward, as it is a step in the right direction.	1.0868733054489936
Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems.	0.614851340205379
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.	1.4006582443033766
As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive.	0.9984312885087339
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links.	0.5260373021701519
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m.	0.5190676815535024
In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime, the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering.	0.8957863331289524
We share them.	0.36089756345266333
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.	1.0050259985109042
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive.	1.0181973003769818
. Mr President, I am full of praise at the sterling efforts of MEPs --some of my Labour colleagues among them - on the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and their efforts towards securing a new Lomé Agreement, which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world.	0.8939515720693056

What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter, to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.	1.0751847741816378

Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet.	0.7281893213740509
Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought. 'If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too.	0.9984667434798186
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.	0.6377603718011463
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - its ability to take the initiative.	1.0097234407245907
Mr President of the Commission, may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure, the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today: that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political.	1.009686772824568
However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality.	0.7453323484378325
To summarise, I consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 European System of Accounts, and I therefore approve it in full, as did the committee.	0.9747279148062252
Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain)	0.3014201848166973

It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises.	0.9826141827687951
That is transparency.	0.3372896896374855
It must be visible.	0.4484695014620729
I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority?	1.195728440462169
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.	1.224214067774492
In response I can only say that this already exists.	0.9938757739772992
A socially just Europe is still highly topical, for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union' s policies.	0.8996731088350602

Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect.	0.9873913065511096
I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew.	0.724372151429341
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock.	1.0354415122688956
To give you an example, in both paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Dutch and German versions, the equivalents of the English words: "in so far as" have been omitted.	1.010513544495033
We are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised.	0.9613539110258488
As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated.	1.0028093490952483
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.	0.7179196613416172
I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world.	0.804658994481015
It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission.	1.1718376542008648
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation.	0.9290315687492425
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission' s implementing a series of reforms, so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission' s period of office is not repeated.	0.7354316048710434

Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out.	0.9466679866794209
What could be the cause of this?	0.7652534195684262
We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive.	0.8312050298253392
The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets.	0.9348504390613825
If not, we will be fighting a running battle.	0.9277934247034076
The travel and tourism sector is the front-runner in making use of ICT tools.	0.51333668972507
In fact, the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted.	0.6770644828857943
These technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries, since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit.	1.1048975996053925
Thank you. You are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a European identity.	0.9298840212265362
We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order.	0.800619937282863
But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity.	0.8678459212551356
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	0.6589955285342648
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.	0.852178527595779
Mr President, this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain fighting for human rights.	0.8374474785680055
Even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets, because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably.	0.8416192737478612
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent.	0.9782124677407582
The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned.	0.851555666780314
There is no opportunity to send a strong message to the Member States: recognising the legal basis of tourism would allow the States to acknowledge one of the European Union' s competences which at the moment, is only exercised in fits and starts.	0.8157593104442536
As far as possible, we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset, instead of having to be tackled separately and later.	0.9873390524536224
The detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal.	0.397698564558703
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously, then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption.	0.9765051292715641
Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link.	0.8603271846542213
I think we need to seize the opportunity.	0.700774814951672
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation.	0.8477569689273038
We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3, financed by LEADER, with those of other actions financed by other Community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership, such as INTERREG, SAPAR, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, in the same areas.	0.9347536087049052
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea.	0.4292044605839704
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets, however.	0.9097673046738644
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today.	1.1701322864979111
Efficiency: I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it.	0.9339857815056231
This is a major task.	1.1200758740816459
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers.	0.5419812275090414
Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation.	0.9204487609491242
We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid.	0.9122257286112485
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas.	1.0024334906855128
These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State.	0.560650344195839
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms.	0.5239644935985988
Consequently, even though this is not a Community priority, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area, provided that these projects contribute to regional development. The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these.	1.1979110346340627
In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks.	1.0221534650079176
Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle.	0.5772423240174713
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims.	0.7122350662805335
Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination, that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere.	0.8372826116754476
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of, or for this fatalist approach towards, market forces as adopted by the liberals - and I am sorry that Mr Gasòliba I Böhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin.	1.0054060274813093
Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter.	1.0737580021586397
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for. I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality.	0.9657667117112525
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today.	0.8166436980794176
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.	0.8554411451111795
Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected.	0.91749196971205
The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever.	1.0515979792387418
The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors.	0.8147974208302409
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date. This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions, the poorer regions in Europe, are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone, as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exist.	0.9994005890048479
The occasional application of Article 308 - formerly Article 235 - which requires unanimity, has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only EUR 8 million for five years and 15 Member States.	0.9626796428442792
In a nutshell, I would like to reiterate the Commission' s conclusion here: it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property.	0.8330739499892381
My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too.	0.8975398876954425
They are very important in this case.	1.0984146962299046
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten.	0.9222975973994166
Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.	0.9514458923966915

If we do this, then heading 7 would be increased accordingly but heading 4 would be decreased by the same amount.	0.8081325145124532
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances.	0.8553562889353195
At the moment, social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy.	0.798704548624658
From that perspective, what I am saying here is of deep relevance.	0.9834809912173915
However, there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the European Union.	0.9131720944270652
Finally, among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement, particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative, but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified.	1.013324015725803
That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals.	1.067133378293517
At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China, the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.	0.8837775077041808
That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community.	1.0015510722062717
Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs.	0.7592841230554802

I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves.	0.7481204793373245
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs.	1.3194664589233012
To summarise, the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	0.8382557535127242
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so.	0.7994090662379661
For me, equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny, alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job.	0.7269730264617529
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard.	0.8743934114641655
But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet.	0.7130200169662089
An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future.	1.0957613676382143
At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.	1.1015489794741882
On the one hand, we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and, on the other hand, we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS, despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre.	0.8956369333150087
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.	0.5544895805161804
These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe.	0.6714705053880812
Does the President of the Council not think that we should stop talking and implement tough measures in this area, bearing in mind that we now have the means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas?	0.9639743550532168
Consequently, these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake. They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred.	0.9576259617817275
Could I also say, Madam President, that the understanding of the presidency, the Portuguese presidency, for our position, was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said, and I quote him, that 'Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation' .	1.1358763834821604
Mr President, 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council.	0.9448959358537029
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.	0.6877479479678431
However, we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties.	1.1019585642558603
I know that this is somewhat controversial, particularly, because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime.	1.00665162004525
The duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as Secretary-General of NATO.	0.593900690471913
Mr Poettering, it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am, albeit for different reasons, for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions.	0.9368836080614511
This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations.	1.0016624892164991
Mr President, we are indeed now in a very rare situation: those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position.	1.1777920480601236
This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order.	0.9048986419954843
Tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their habitual place of residence and thus confers mobility, the characteristic feature of contemporary society.	0.6742393203377034
In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors.	0.5930553618343958
Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.	1.026277978306715
There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved.	0.9678104434507295
We have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law.	0.763237210486569
I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too.	1.0870406612087637
But I should like to stress the fact that, on this issue of the environment, the budget issue is a central one and Parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal.	1.1530592812436837
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky, which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream.	0.787582799514808
This is very good, and we are pleased to see it.	1.601166521525348
The third area of incoherence is human rights.	0.4805861200123197
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.	1.171555102615591
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative.	0.5898268637772757
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF.	1.2376239369470166

The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee.	0.7079574134829335
The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process.	0.9504460259323824
So that is the first priority, the competitiveness of regional economies.	1.1996446346273828
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas.	0.931992088546615
Employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism.	0.716950863667041

Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.	0.9586422420698704
While, on the one hand, we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary, we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved.	1.0910015313607924
Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion.	1.0276528017976791
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.	0.8469893822499142
Mr Swoboda' s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level.	0.6426370492395526
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society, economic policy and reforms.	1.0219946568483602
We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector.	0.7458639809194828

If you travel to the Netherlands, you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free.	0.6485782670116448
However, we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council, as referred to at Helsinki, was contested recently.	1.023549790135328
In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance.	0.9858101498637741
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?	0.8281344825200849
And less social protection means less purchasing power, fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees.	0.37861121940834047
As has already been mentioned here, there are indications - no proof, but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.	1.0742596767952002
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	0.8661857195940396

Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment.	0.9084627602029041
. (DE) Mr Cohn-Bendit, I do not think that the European Parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country' s domestic politics, in the way that you are doing.	1.0027277171663087
(FR) The Commission' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War.	0.7214066717878159
Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past.	1.216309408588178
That message must be taken back from here today.	0.725249908967154
We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point.	1.0197064977273294
There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now.	0.8693133434438887
The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives at this stage.	0.9639416586597042
There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part.	0.6554950811722248
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here.	0.7235420484159157
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty.	0.9237545576341293
In April 1999, Parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island, and help towards a political solution, but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution.	1.0589282626127918
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context.	1.0748880308592852
I attach great importance, ladies and gentlemen, in a spirit of discipline and transparency, to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information, and not to propaganda, and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union.	0.8947285404638424
In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model.	1.1345058676398825
No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union' s credibility.	0.8583218038155437
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	0.33778893000529925
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control.	0.6699388631590656
This applies to every country.	0.4727112133341109
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal?	0.6391793407282307
It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved.	1.053621890817513
The filtration camps are camps in which torture, rape and violations are perpetrated: we know that now.	0.48824760873163287
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one.	1.0350557396245972
Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference?	1.1417935335193243
This is a crucial goal.	1.0700098578654713
Madam President, with apologies to my friend, Enrique Barón Crespo, I should like to speak against this proposal.	0.9485012093260377
This issue, which has an impact on their everyday life, is a key issue as regards EU credibility.	1.1971691294213698
I say now, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past: yes, I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House, but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs.	1.12590592472209
The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD))	0.5748636569758891
This responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, however much we like to see him or hear him talk, or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation.	1.137776566826523
It plays down one of the Treaties' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions' policies and measures. It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others.	1.2724836898292022
Mr President, our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group: you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems, rather than being defined as the problem.	0.8246596325250091
It is nothing less than legal torture.	0.583103171180656
Furthermore, on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States, which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons, I shall, in the next few days, be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders.	1.0388470669595473
It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly.	0.9884754729593804
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems, for example, disabled people' s access to the workplace.	0.7359708059749364
Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country' s statutes to another' s.	0.6102096608135262
We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards.	0.6441467324419247
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course.	0.7337458047455603
It is, after all, only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law. Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.	0.7605100036044339
Particular emphasis is given to the point that women' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more crèches should be built.	0.8835465810334018
In the last programming period 9% of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives.	0.7726717118002913
Reform of European competition policy	0.36785247918154046
The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle.	0.5982843069075789
It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall.	0.48999938809935234
Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North, the Europe of the Lutherans, Calvinists and Quakers, wishes to inflict its moral order on us.	0.7691328109743378
As regards the national and/or local level of employee involvement, the Commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented, as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions.	0.8286930330671896
The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU' s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex.	1.0141129406783376
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability?	0.48789620682851526
I will have to repeat these arguments, modestly, in this intervention, because the same issue has arisen once again.	0.9067071004289652
I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits.	0.6275257018670134
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.	1.091131232549669
A coherent legal framework must be re-established.	0.42990910991310705
We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion.	0.7305902274957049
I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep.	1.030536385646754
Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.	1.1501951180080314
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February.	1.0562637835466537
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.	1.1385295944299636
In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission' s watchdog.	1.0358463729694714
Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance.	0.9525625942005268
However, I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe, so that these jobs can be secured in the future.	0.8106190229357881
On one hand we have the exuberance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and, on the other, more widespread exclusion.	1.0480939987603486
.	-0.0
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive.	0.8408644147415943
(NL) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement.	0.8821648818003667
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity.	0.7851901384924819
Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted.	0.8427497270744156
50% or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest.	0.7444149906330717
I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures.	0.8424705038107363
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems.	1.0511813222708275
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances.	0.6624821381505346
Secondly, like him, I think that we should not promote excessive concentration in funds which, in the final analysis, will prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds.	1.0447186198950098
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper.	0.6606138671517963
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve?	0.974999596828226
That is naturally unacceptable.	0.40878556078319667
They turn a blind eye to the masters of corruption, the big groups controlling oil, water supply, or public works. They could clamp down on them since their head offices are here in Europe.	0.9396014857001685
It is never easy working on comitology.	0.4223170634326012
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality.	0.7909631731759472
However, we must remember that, in addition to URBAN, a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector: innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation, pilot projects, particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities.	0.9696130508736782
I should add that today, at a time when Europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of Fascists in a government within the European Union, it is no longer acceptable to have an ultraliberalism which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same Europe.	0.9067715086805677
We should salute it - and I think we do.	1.1122104732865332
I am pleased that the Council is considering this question.	1.219675696176461
It also creates protection for software and databases.	0.4080825534941632
Again on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have asked the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue, which is frankly unsatisfactory.	0.9967864277810327
But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this, and with good reason, because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction.	1.168834093392032
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.	0.9527866141296985
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament.	1.1804377588939667
The Commission' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point.	0.7242294122493472
Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade.	1.2190514310349416
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.	1.045846148319391
- (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission.	0.7076934755513411
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people' s quality of life.	0.9850493881507368
Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing.	0.7383400605503083
The economic value of the postal service was recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail.	0.9575278529231752
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.	0.6969884766947195
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises.	0.645188448257576
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group, which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle.	0.9458300755517751
Values should take precedence over power.	0.33553923447230516
The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.	0.8721993766751817
It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.	0.9176102469141522
However, we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective.	1.026471746313245
Like honourable Members I recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the Balkan tragedy, in particular when it comes to integrating the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country.	1.0211058503607515
Once again, we are losing a piece of our planet' s cultural and ecological heritage, despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights, on the protection of minorities, rights of indigenous peoples, etc., which have already been ratified.	1.0416793457952767
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions.	0.9654985290352007
The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok, and is suffering the consequences of that failure.	0.8379530252665123
This was an important consideration for us.	0.5244063698943898
Last November, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive.	0.9239618406861959
We have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva.	0.7599764063064015
Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action.	0.8345849794733137
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue, since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed, to be crushed.	1.084034330203871
This is why I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are, or will be, involved in European military crisis management plans.	1.0279363896948548
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union, and to deal with the notorious problem, which will no doubt arise again, of the aim of a Community register.	1.1229071148366265
In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well.	0.49499836527905106
It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council' s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body' .	0.8851484631828989
As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources.	0.9530382668890025
I really think that people should be extremely cautious.	0.5696019302891031
Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.	1.203600052258642
Yet words spoken, written or signed are not in themselves enough.	0.6387446303328139
We consider that, given the hydrological characteristics of Spain, where transfers of a structural nature are carried out, the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources, and these decisions should, of course, always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water.	0.9073743479327185
That cannot continue.	0.30012623920367965
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest.	1.0979168188675401
It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.	1.004087277200165
As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe, it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business, that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back.	1.0479605353824577
(Parliament approved the joint text)	0.4318474613172796
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.	0.9653766180119183
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.	1.0533073210290995
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000.	0.7995905893674193
France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds.	0.9353284430842018
Incidentally, many thanks to Mr Scharping, the Chairman of the European Social Democrats, for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in Austria from his homepage and therefore not advising anarchists in favour of violent action to go to Vienna tomorrow.	0.9574544561124265
In the Sunday papers all over Greece: the Ministry of Public Works concerning the structural fund: the Minister' s work; the Ministry of Agriculture: the Minister' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the Ministry of Telecommunications: the work of the Minister for Telecommunications; the Ministry of Education: the work of the Minister for Education and a photograph of the Minister; the Ministry of Employment: the work of the Minister for Employment, a photograph of the Minister and a photograph of the State Secretary, and behind them all the symbols of the Community Support Framework.	0.992000625379881
This is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently.	1.0363637747415706
Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme.	1.1691000625118855
The German Government' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.	0.6155009659989288
Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection.	0.9982254269831815
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council.	0.7291598212381811
As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society.	0.6907173177803737
We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology.	0.7438875623815007
Today, following the 1997 compromise, Member States can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff, with a weight of less than 350 grammes.	0.7700561145919291
However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission' s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued.	0.907830380357326
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world.	1.092251618620683
The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry.	0.5997370060966385
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand.	0.7319792670988219
It is not a lot to ask.	1.2007459278643646
That is excellent news!	0.29473997869954266
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate, and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer.	1.0669207192962455
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week.	0.6293548082031627
We will not achieve concrete results during this stage of negotiations, which is a delicate and sensitive phase, by exploiting tensions.	0.9571599359189339
This will also be important with a view to the special summit in March, where tourism is bound to be mentioned as a significant contributor to employment.	0.8959808423996215
We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too.	0.6193623225602782
That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.	0.8542027391840705
This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management.	0.8592579839632134
By means of this extraordinary procedure, Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs, namely with the previous Commission.	0.8385574292506071
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast, effective work of the conference, prior to enlargement.	0.8221532096807896
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament.	0.6120751147926302
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.	0.5462302140180734
It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again.	0.9533653067071519
However, I would like to say, Mr Newton Dunn, that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable.	1.128814560047449
Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights.	0.5877278998845258
As regards other aspects of this subject, Mr President, I would refer you to my written report.	0.8866902430218244
Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly.	1.0170425657246218
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority.	0.8918382227313617
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries.	0.7821689188995233
When we talk of transparency in the food chain, that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs.	0.7881125393816392
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles, and I think we ought to add this provision to it.	1.2508398770830618
However, I would just like to add the following.	0.9270420747922489
While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way, overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported.	1.1027216448513864
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas, we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality.	0.7623546341813492
The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear.	0.6814848491151021
The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support.	0.9490432156512753
Turning to the specific questions that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has put to us, I shall group them into three basic areas: the fight against organised crime, the operation of the Judicial Network, particularly as regards criminal matters, and questions on Europol.	1.0061202342493856
In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission.	1.0450856295707578
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform.	0.620530394629801
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing?	0.6222268898697969
We would, at the same time, like to insist on other things.	0.8653018578615868
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously.	0.8282704172660108
The authority of this House could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa.	1.2523884480411351

Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.	0.6100587758874264
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.	0.7525493122895849
In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable.	0.9929684370487851
The values at stake are too central, too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises.	0.6546495007411232
The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	1.0224348664029819

Representatives of the Council, within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament.	0.8703205054248845
Thank you for your reply.	0.6121386700651964
Moreover, I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope.	1.196943205803143
As regards the issue of cacao, chocolate: I repeat that the 5% has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries.	0.9738770306297277
The debate about either extending the Lomé Convention with its quotas and protectionism, or, instead, gradually winding down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a warped debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and impoverishment of those countries.	0.8301472826412232
The European Union, for its part, will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement.	1.0396830671205872
It is minimalist on a number of points, especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of, and conditions for, implementing the derogations.	0.8715443648732139
The Commission' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States' courts.	1.0981208643962252
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter.	1.0843169883132189

We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency.	1.1568258147820443
Addressing the fundamental question of relations with the United States, the Commission mentions just one priority: 'we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade' (page 4).	0.7820085269140618
It may be true, as was said here, that today we have new possibilities, e.g. electronic possibilities such as e-mail, but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very, very important role and that, in particular, young families, the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail.	1.0341219368733685
Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures.	1.1901661990607577
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism.	0.8978991401864855
In Spain they say a letter to the three kings.	0.5230555380357789
In order to assert our fundamental values, they need to be laid down in writing, as a matter of urgency, and, beyond this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution.	1.0895061018658088
The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield.	0.6536132847463114
The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities.	1.077775432901937
President. I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	0.8121205947547032
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.	0.9477740398133981
Why is it so important in that sector?	0.41273868315685514
In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset.	0.9929982808876445
The Portuguese Presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities, as furthermore, did the President of the European Parliament, when she stated this at the Helsinki European Council.	0.9649731666742232
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness, the Dalai Lama' s, proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair?	0.7689172660478489
What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority.	0.6941106175141126
In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements, measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified.	0.9085903747425556
However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands.	1.0222688201886232
A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly, through Mr Guterres, by condemning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control.	0.7899030620928025
Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs.	0.7561331155264405
These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question.	0.8574829901715663
We all know the picture.	0.7495932454330158
I am surprised, however, at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of Community policy.	0.8971076924620426
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.	0.790001562219373
Furthermore, I have asked the president of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, that is to say the Office in Alicante, to comment further on this new question and I can, as a result, inform the honourable Member as follows, on behalf of the Office:	1.1432917490964

I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	0.8792359030710523

The joint debate is closed.	0.4838502538114039
We must strike a balance between them.	0.5788595969302556
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued.	0.8881379932716408
This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament.	0.7022904519578966
Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us.	0.797662734256153
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	0.40057293036571995
Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment.	1.0240720670875847
Thirdly, I should like to address the question of the timetable.	1.1320048780600618
That is what Culture 2000 represents.	0.7480866315307992
This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catches could be unloaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry.	0.528242706101156
Does this mean more flexibility, insecurity and fixed-term contracts?	0.5701944544118737
The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses.	0.5456517332255502
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	1.0705498311469892
We will cut them off.	0.36627118756033017
Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.	0.8287357480012695
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.	0.883447964882794
You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2.	0.9776253274095053
So much for the first comment.	1.0113975908638495
It is the result, first and foremost, of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour.	0.9741735704537213
So, the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all.	1.000057674613738
It is worth pointing out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the Council, in accordance with Article 190, and the assent of this Parliament, to which it falls to approve this statute.	1.0212932837749795
The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer: the producer has been forced to bear all the cost.	0.9097956781485251
The process does not require a chemical sewage plant.	0.5170371080652185
My fear - even if you shake your head, Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years, that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers.	1.1918319586548292
Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on. But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened.	0.78914790394538
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects.	0.7803551632097939
It has become eminently political.	0.5287591409034246
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable.	0.2384518817704413
I should just like to say, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions, but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on.	1.102840342119249
We need to open that debate.	0.6080429648310373
Our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning, action to prevent juvenile delinquency, the reintegration of offenders, and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved, for example the police, the courts and social services.	0.9016136741193437
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.	0.9740579619901018
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme.	0.7872811271500415
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems.	0.8906453110875449
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.	0.8403278499918776
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups.	0.5999796399686694
Yet a worrying situation is apparent.	0.38649002301382474
We have taken good note of your intentions.	0.9482835991084917
Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up.	1.0825889939828703
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.	0.8502817581555766
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region, the Azores, one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral.	0.8827718315713908
It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action.	1.0773429130939327
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors.	0.792715205024689
Like the rapporteur, we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA.	1.1149038187426505
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States.	0.9053106368572891
So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.	0.9885350182974603
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and, to a lesser extent, in rationalisation.	0.9331972250127278
It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health.	1.186692984310632
In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.	1.0071010820918471
Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission' s White Paper.	1.1290407329111098
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture.	0.9847750970663183
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas.	0.8068501315577202
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet.	0.9199611418694432
Many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights. The belief is widespread that many human rights, including the right to life, contradicted as it is by the death penalty, depend on certain variables, while globalisation, which often has a negative connotation, is in danger of becoming the catch-all for rights, actions and policies everywhere in the world.	1.0339559057654282
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	0.22702980582267773
Here too, Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lomé Convention.	0.7679344601564883
How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries?	1.1199156746212586
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary.	0.9646577088276158
It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south, particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle.	0.9741195668773821
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, just like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of Community territory under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	0.8851509211435881
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament.	0.8862957171875229
For a long time, many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures, when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments, particularly for humanitarian intervention.	0.9092902242506741
For example, a management company might be doing underwriting business and, if not able to sell, it would put the securities in the fund it would manage, or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did brokering business.	0.8433802153521062
If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.	0.9996124990611043
Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade) if it is adopted?	0.7641715633814952
I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives.	0.9249837578815209
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined.	0.5590367745836502
Now, we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully.	1.1143180528402465
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.	0.7665327302865677
The European Community' s prime role is to ensure a framework which enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimise and realise the tourism sector' s potential for growth and employment.	0.7564316520311419
However, experience has taught me that, in politics, modest ambitions are never the key to success!	0.8504790121733877
The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired.	0.7156713259185911
We have all spoken favourably of this programme' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation.	0.9153150077277329
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up".	1.1094198595884293
Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner' s proposal to create a European civil protection body.	1.306351443670644
We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights.	0.7438071355912571
As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals.	0.8611691260186216
This is an urgent duty for the EU.	0.8683639420975265
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, amongst other things, the report on LEADER+ and, as a result, agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions, believing that that process could be effective on two conditions: that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community, and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities.	0.8275203421300762
To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.	0.850931367191224
It is just a question of how.	1.0408445735427951
The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us, they want clarity; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote.	0.9980970478705755
It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU.	0.6866469560913523
We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised.	0.5420280333642306
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion.	1.0954797027615744
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process.	0.9125524242029676
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst.	1.1870345804386324
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy.	0.7181587355317084
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move.	0.9348694996522384
We ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements: political representatives and public administrations, companies and economic operators, and social operators, including unions and non-governmental organisations.	0.9298943439193779
In the context of providing information, I would like to draw the Commission' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents.	0.8314241462677061
We know that most Austrians respect these values.	0.48799719127019975
We have serious reservations about the Council' s proposed amendments.	0.5364994649243365
Canada has invited the Sudanese for peace talks.	0.24420516322455305
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself. As I have told Parliament, the task before us is immense and ambitious, and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge.	1.2213837048524756
Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.	0.9234246006582744
First of all, I would like to say that I agree with the priorities you have identified concerning personal responsibility, Mr Posselt.	1.0089891756874807
The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men, which, as you have said, is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis, if necessary.	0.9164669148246626
Just now, Commissioner Liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed.	0.915129193878743
The European Union' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy.	0.9016855701862491
That is indeed distortion of the internal market.	0.6311377704367985
How decisions are made is all-important.	0.46670930666546173
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.	1.3272991433286645
This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and, if necessary, abandon the scheme altogether.	0.8974802429599258
The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved.	1.0189303357016122
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten.	0.6721430464555681
Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.	1.2842349942663567
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project.	1.1177406550165423
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	0.5326485053586363
In this it said that in a few years' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances.	0.9305527405846321
We see it as positive that an attempt is being made to reverse the trend towards water degradation, which is most alarming and which governments all too often tend to sweep under the carpet.	0.7736913608247217
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called "core tasks".	0.772804708119269
However, I would like to insist on certain points.	0.8737700682387595
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45, in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer, for new cars at any rate.	0.998548615096454
Recently, I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner, precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility, both for products and for services.	1.0143195165788048
The Tibet Intergroup, therefore, gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet, calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue.	0.8696535586336452
Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or, at least, this Parliament is unable to do so.	1.0494029215146177
It has to be said that, in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy, the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies.	0.9272772085204185
As you know, as currently framed, Community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards.	0.8556226974978697
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government.	0.6588391815770199
It is already employed widely in the transport sector.	0.702977267034189
During the presidential elections, it appeared that things were not running too smoothly, but compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could serve as a model.	0.8038449931060325
But we should not lower our standards too much either.	0.5979469499769521
It should not be dramatised into something more than that.	0.6050469760235437
As you requested, I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing systems.	1.0858244965147739
The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government.	0.6693469867232562
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help me in my task as a new Member.	0.9920374352220291
Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results.	0.9701595114399058
I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently, nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies.	0.7209420141673253
However, this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling.	0.8439259946049251
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent.	0.6731491129923635
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.	0.6983567188601029
Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.	1.066569639068624
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.	0.9920578641103766
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left.	0.8043587898665254
There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks.	1.09083607087844
The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU.	1.1433412647231973
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union.	1.211311566433715
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.	0.8216070633613889
What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia?	1.0971723328176748
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region.	0.7605814248151803
. Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy.	0.9875330931169064
Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry.	0.8946250506235675
As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means.	0.7440615208247915
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago.	0.8691856024593427
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need.	0.9608716390571109
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.	0.9224933108444259
Through the Stability Pact, we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation.	0.9524688879164717
Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe.	1.0697788643408428
In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital.	1.0275388623532469
This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	0.878975321607749
The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted.	0.8613739496088144
That could convince people that Europe, in its governance, is not something run exclusively from Brussels, which concentrates and soaks up more powers, more decisions, more authority.	1.1182411536864634
The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.	1.0002946292295936
This is something I favour, but currently as part of a minority in my own Group.	1.1863438177823067
I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way.	1.1456128754869739
It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and 'undercover' activities, and the interception of telephone calls.	0.842999801896168
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect.	0.918875378298402
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.	1.095132075034058
I have three short questions, the first being as follows.	0.8497285910819964
Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs.	0.9263766167918117
It would really be a nuisance if Parliament were to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extending its powers.	0.5494354051822499
Nonetheless, we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content.	0.9462713081680278
Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future.	0.9877112493156529
Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this, with all due sympathy to Cuba.	0.9762359709445484
In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done, although I know that this is not pleasant.	1.0246645826023357
Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems.	0.7399903867037185
Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe, and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance, and that on the day that you present your interesting report.	1.1172734853070458
For example, to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union. This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions, for example.	0.9830046241776954
In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.	0.9542594498864896
I say that wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and, as a consequence of that, extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position, the integration we are supporting here, and the prosperity it will produce, will translate into the détente and openness we all seek and from which all of us, especially the Cuban people, will benefit.	0.9835587637218655
An essential component of this joint effort should, in any case, be this Parliament' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty.	0.8414847121230364
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union.	0.8469317425800428
In reply to your second point on the Court of Justice, we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago.	0.9526037519631487
I would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few Members this morning and, Mr President, with your permission, I will do this in English.	1.0259081628454885
This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission.	0.946225261727223
The Commission' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity.	0.8278810876513325
Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe.	1.260479279649914
We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them.	0.9746500404339947
Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied.	1.0953488627755141
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened.	0.8501219537265414
It is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and I think it is very important for this to be reflected in the Commission' s proposal and that of the European Parliament, as well as in the compromise motions.	1.2660180587296304
I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination.	0.9208016412988919
A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.	0.6551124714685251
We both come from Sweden. In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local.	0.8442409919197487
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	0.5120114914736799
In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission.	1.1962699006898558
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors.	0.4425060509847676
That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere.	0.7253679621787994
Granted, as you say, that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States, nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle.	0.893726805201978
For example, I would not refer to the government of Nicosia.	1.1297397134155027
The INTERREG initiative, created in 1990, is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a 'Europe without frontiers' in the context of establishing the great single market.	0.8583904419914538
On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement.	1.0749263541718752
Here, in my opinion, the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies.	0.8897847087883638
How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs?	1.0678505615348723
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area.	0.9507067580124083
Moreover, what is the real significance of financial ceilings if they are increased for every new action?	0.8629069651569217
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country. The second principle is that of equal opportunities, particularly for men and women, as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union.	1.1081727849160767
The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this.	0.7178149880529134
We will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting. However, I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies.	1.001756754362052
The difficult part, which will fall to the Convention, is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the Treaties.	0.9735428245795807
However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart.	1.0438378471606815
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.	0.8428322714644848
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider' s party.	0.9883310944499433
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan.	0.9997162543625249
The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network, since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust, this option cannot be ruled out at present.	1.038445769897589
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources.	0.6379113982216434
For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account.	1.025680623364206
Mr President, it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive.	0.8111500260256911
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people used to be summoned to demonstrations by letter or telegram; nowadays this is done by e-mail and via websites!	0.644102028885252
Through the agreement, the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty.	0.9492709442896522
The time is now right, I think, to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation.	0.9315261664746269
Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union.	0.9559629840029212
Why do I think we need the directive so much?	0.9340165787431345
Regarding information and training, in the past this budget line has been allocated for information, communication and training.	0.8512874426858312
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue.	0.7109158075496722
This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.	0.9284622950662917
Numerous policies have already gone in this direction, albeit laboriously, and many more still need to do so before Europe, in terms of subsidiarity, is seen as one house, not only by its own people, but also by those in the candidate countries.	1.2047613345655939
Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee.	1.0737097695957536
Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU' s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly.	1.202509551070442
There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish.	0.5865960979124447
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis' anti-Semitism, which of course is completely incorrect.	0.6340837503445638
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.	0.7884801613469651
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible.	0.7700206928448641
But I really feel that, in the circumstances, we want to know what the implications would be for business.	1.0596848076600593
A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases.	1.0898402730959955
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners.	0.6870942718044535
However, Madam President, these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow, and which the Socialists will vote in favour of, will put in place one of the European Union' s most important programmes.	1.1074164315124866
Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive.	0.4211197743999274
That has only happened recently.	0.45030222484847465
Following this interview, the representatives of this Forum presented her with a text entitled "Strasbourg Declaration" . The President wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this "declaration" .	0.7884946920460251
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union.	1.2002914362437356
Of course, the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable; I was almost going to say 'irreparable' .	0.8373493006001808
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament.	1.203840981403021
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation.	0.8992690091139998
Mr President, I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency.	0.6845595743344539
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world.	0.8981440967417326
It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services.	0.8948664224429105
This exists, but it is only a small part of what we are discussing.	1.1952153903755538
The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies, the central theme of today' s debate.	0.7671705626011486
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated.	0.8824161957316279
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars.	0.5869860119075335
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there, but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes.	1.0264347680156944
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end.	0.7465040654017909
Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe.	0.751555946969632
Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom.	0.9006385471032671
It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service.	0.8585359991907308
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.	0.7766424894837377
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi.	1.1257638082881698
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.	0.7989763621460035
(Applause)	-0.0
The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time.	1.2273563049695284
The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on.	0.7838163489698445
Mr President, with the implementation of INTERREG III, European cooperation policy is entering a new phase.	1.0695835405382974
But we have to grasp the tools to do that.	0.9827970443232014
We will soon see, and for our part, we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue.	1.2548201388701206
I am certain, therefore, that an island such as Malta, with its population of 340 000 cannot accommodate the rigidities of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater.	1.0046573236414544
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic, racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it.	0.4717750719523925
On the one hand, it continued to refuse to accept the term "European cultural policy" or other similar terms, even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty, and it defines "Culture 2000" simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more.	0.9550036972500583
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process.	0.864984200932712
This report is about the Commission.	1.0647853855993468
I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated.	0.7400498524903666
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament' s position on the matter, in accordance with the Code of Conduct.	0.9617885133805881
The debate is closed.	0.18322982179810382
At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used.	0.5898918220564331
I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied.	1.0241036246337967
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority.	0.7700279183728022
My request is, in fact, to put this country back on the top of the agenda.	0.9776110324229085
The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field.	1.0119659551083329
I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being.	0.769992397307921
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning.	0.9153436791155116
Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular?	1.0526226781773962
In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution.	0.5261383357506175
Retrospective law is bad law, it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law.	0.6081670058524713
Quite simply, I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas, because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved.	1.165954474128361
We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival.	0.3628310898626922
Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed.	1.2799201540743503
I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real.	1.1264370357275295
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years.	1.0250209789764868
This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries.	0.8868779200079917
That is positive.	0.36810545864255817
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.	0.9557268931294917
Indeed, I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.	0.9876404054606972
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy.	0.814167153403595
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.	0.8139050879761119
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.	0.6708400358282627
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.	1.1710062199426747
Madam President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano, I should like to ask the question: in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contravention of general international law, in contravention of the Treaties, in contravention of morality, who is pulling the strings?	0.962223796144973
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament on the Bonino List, I intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf. It is a vote against this report, or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based.	1.0319468783755714
Finally, I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated, if you consider, in addition, that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II.	1.4051404508777532
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut.	0.8508173078734597
In essence, FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia, regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy.	0.6607549525965218
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women.	0.9655451270761244
(Applause from the PSE Group)	0.3442395890706472
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened.	0.678383151340633
We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics.	1.094016886215679
We must therefore find a political solution.	0.8730038311251015
The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland.	0.9656112407218117
And when that assessment is complete, we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us.	0.7709615965884677
We need hard and fast rules.	0.1887096460970465
I would like once again to thank all the speakers, and also, especially, the Vice-President, Mr Provan, for his magnificent work throughout this debate, particularly during the conciliation procedure, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and, also, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, and all the Members who have participated in this work.	1.1584279202931904
Plus, this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act, which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too.	1.0821227815230636
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle, which is a bottomless pit in financial terms.	0.7821263460484469
We must reject what is unacceptable, as our constituents demand.	0.9047738965501667
It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban.	0.744874775005242
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market.	1.1959103223989862
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission' s proposals and Parliament and, having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions, I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made, with apologies if I cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name.	1.0774840551163969
This would make our rapporteur' s life considerably easier in the future.	0.5682274966548506
You have fulfilled your objective for today, which is to answer all the questions.	1.0384977358285532
As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is on the spot today.	1.0356699207625095
We therefore await, and I await, the European Commission' s proposals on this matter.	1.1792344956312555
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.	0.9997621935731498
With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept.	1.0649447643965657
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.	0.838181487537769
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said.	0.9629557895017307
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report, and I now await the Commission' s response to our requests and demands.	0.7932402653153399
It will not be tolerated, and must stop immediately.	1.0100131627589282
I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union.	0.9687742717373407
The EU is also a union for employment and social justice.	1.2398329256110767
I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47.	0.8144189590878563
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible?	0.7768659694668552
What establishes a recognised minority?	0.16051793958314028
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy.	0.7770839586429887
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.	0.5224783040384446
But I do not believe today, nor have I ever believed, that our burgeoning economic relationship with China - manifested, for example, by China' s EUR 25 billion surplus with the European Union - should silence us when it comes to China' s human rights record.	0.9871838564594592
We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy, employment policy and social policy.	0.9683302602328523
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks, as Prime Minister Barak has promised.	0.7815960148550458
In order to be effective, it must be well anchored in the Member States' national authorities.	1.0311351306424932
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement.	0.9524051785205848
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents.	0.9936049700487644
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment.	1.013463178241519
Madam President, we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party in Austria, which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part, and which sends our support to anti-racist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people.	1.028654463381006
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament.	1.0800308116003072
Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet, but, furthermore, there are certain questions to be borne in mind.	1.1616224019327377
But these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors.	0.7250999701143606
Resolution on the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005	0.6138839383179466
For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success.	1.192452324589143
It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee.	0.8009407284043775
However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause.	0.9479453373577618
Community policy in the field of water	0.48687334181888436
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned, otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens.	0.9897309652562147
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence.	1.009080073463717
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.	0.878319666578355
This brings me to the content of the report.	0.7799929370717998
Unfortunately, my Dutch is not as good as yours.	0.891171993997625
But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of "privatisation" and "liberalisation"!	0.9365615407436949
Mr President, it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher, put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety.	0.9196323107643073
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door.	0.6850614721977849
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry?	0.8810563793197996
Otherwise it is merely the financial processing, at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens, of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration.	0.8519320289040251
We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished.	0.8631067550507302
Do you think that, when we legislate about chemicals, we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future?	1.1591136546150251
I do not believe so.	0.9365425466003248
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER+ programmes.	1.0916965113125854
I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020.	0.7394887667592484
Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar.	0.8247756942161959
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first.	0.7530569490346299
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary.	0.8763399927874646
Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal, for example in regard to jurisdiction, the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime.	1.0357235472423265
This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe.	0.926728574701809
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma. Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.	1.0326564871417792
However, problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE, for example, funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related, whereas INTERREG funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis.	0.7541687470878371
My third point has also been mentioned already.	0.7933424678392961
The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions.	0.7680136517849577
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed.	1.0401172583343612
The forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010, but unfortunately for Europe there is a reverse trend.	0.78721234375449
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.	0.7889623647646135
This is the purpose of these guidelines.	0.9176915215243439
The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector.	0.8214805683277728
It should not be in the amendment.	0.9559885642793772
In this way, LEADER+ can, together with the programmes under Regulation (EC) No 1257/99, consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside.	0.661418725849283
I perfectly understand Mr Staes' s concerns.	0.4111620286551255
What we should do now, I feel, is wait, particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service, which many of our fellow citizens still value highly.	0.9649673692170428
VOTE	-0.0
That is a question of solidarity and progress.	0.8546783818503676
And now the Erika.	0.3574176276748065
The bet before us is a bet with time.	0.5851294753855776
This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers.	0.8090241682825314
However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present.	1.2021357391049157
It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians.	0.5991461264610082
But in Belgium too, there are a great number of people, older people for example, who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman.	1.062167750679193
These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them.	0.7454026473774638
I would also like to remind Members that, as a candidate for membership of the European Union, Turkey will - and this is a pre-accession condition, which is an important point - sooner or later, as part of its own pre-accession strategy, have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time, and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety.	1.068571431856482
First, funding for preparation; second, implementation; third, mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience, and fourth, technical assistance.	0.8265951662040837
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.	1.042379141020116
Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews.	1.0528044634800753
Well, he was wrong, and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances.	0.8628705522069268
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary.	0.7020263401600008
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four.	0.7677782590469617
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya.	1.0031653841926582
Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.	0.9168778773605152
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates?	0.897510308156396
I also welcome the White Paper.	0.6690814649120997
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law. Without fragility, without complacency, without ambiguity, but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people.	1.1932440375117683
For the day has dawned: two irresponsible politicians, consumed with a lust for power, are selling Austria' s image, political role, and to some extent even its economic interests, down the river!	0.8007193580361661
In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States.	0.9532502316162923
I believe that this proposal should remain, as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union.	1.0310877695531429
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly, by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud.	0.8670526267511595
Mr Theonas, I can only repeat what I said to Mr Alavanos.	1.1498155702996327
As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group, I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission.	0.8912484063278238
The police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence, so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities. It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them.	1.0102500747217982
Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments.	0.5992422392228679
However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men.	0.928408056551915
Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.	0.8768186083749078
It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal.	0.8119568610212071
They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union.	0.9317732423434417
It will be easier to take account of the developing countries' very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies.	1.0597530624599318
It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem.	0.8422344373301365
This is not a clear case of incoherence, it is more a case of a competition between suppliers.	0.9975992690962475
Yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and, as such, a threat to Macedonia' s stability.	0.9301715129681205
I belong to the great majority of Members of Parliament who voted in favour of continuing the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme. I regret that Parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme, which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency, but I acknowledge that this was not an easy operation.	1.0855588727162702
Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right.	1.1166661137990508
Report (A5-0007/2000) by Mr Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)0003 - C5-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD))	0.695398887374811
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year.	0.4461397688834419
I emphatically support the rapporteur' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive, from the list of measures to the question of employment measures.	0.9669758457308839
The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these, with certain changes in the wording.	1.0927624068313921
This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed.	0.7589434987572493
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.	0.7282290617690249
The affected area is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. Many local and European associations have strongly criticised the project.	0.653071090476662
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.	0.9106633880702368
What exactly do you intend to liberalise?	0.38406258046599445
We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years.	0.9055727170474159
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas.	1.0203788118739427
I would like to end on the following point. Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.	1.0107206463653466
Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States.	0.8853938442627912
We are to get the agendas.	0.9707468115384892
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand.	1.0892231719865506
This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure.	0.9968167356540132
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless.	0.874507992481599
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on.	0.7653538368943573
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles.	1.0469854074422265
As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique.	0.5528510442623107
First OSPAR.	-0.0
Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission. But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.	1.216189781634653
Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see.	1.1014952835156522
Where the question of the budget is concerned, I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	0.9411895227468517
Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal.	1.0024969890471038
Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions.	0.7850546539809046
Once again, an indigenous people' s right of existence is being threatened.	0.7057323878344499
We are all acting as if this is not really happening, but we all know that it is.	1.4028148058647698
To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply.	0.9217607031989048
Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.	1.033355791740478
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism.	0.914405110367118
We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area.	0.5775449957612617
Happy Valentine' s Day!	0.4702699881987129
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency?	0.787262289260587
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today.	0.7960968030585618
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions.	1.095707860721198
As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.	0.80954586678983
In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects.	1.006277371450504
It is clear that this model' s logic of private profit has been harmful, and therefore the 'polluter pays' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences.	0.8317685550832299
Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.	0.9928154138634303
The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted.	0.9842765754164617
Mr President, Commissioner, since the issue of employment has been raised, I want to recall another issue which is also very serious, namely the bankruptcies among Tour Operators and their consequences mainly for hotels, which are small or medium enterprises lacking the necessary organisation and access to information that would indicate to them whether or not their contractual partners are trustworthy.	0.8980749261926457
Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.	0.8795340408326596
In actual fact, there are still certain differences of opinion within the Council over the type of convention, and over certain provisions contained therein.	0.879108839238942
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.	0.9497384992726423
I have explained the position of the Commission.	0.6982557855565802
In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit.	0.9761897224421967
The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time.	0.6285504992119152
Over the past 25 years, no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop.	1.019685128876564
No new knowledge was needed, because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold.	0.7434214020929675
Madam President, has my vote been counted? I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card.	1.0859086723940456
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system.	0.8697402932296096
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and, of course, point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme.	0.9645835855495759
Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia. It is you who has created this mess.	0.8960895622440075
(End of fiction).	0.2856862462162394
To conclude, the next five years will be crucial.	0.8892033340754792
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.	1.1239028621565517
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand.	1.0124227429123356
Inhabitants of countries in the European Union ought, nonetheless, to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection, irrespective of which country they live in.	0.9409073777906934
But NATO' s decision for military intervention and the KLA' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony, as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia.	0.7953096660092055
The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States' arguments.	0.9638167693375678
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	0.9420752392097687
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	0.8330238258838749
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.	0.820631296201121
It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe, providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it.	0.8001152643353354
We succeeded there in agreeing, at an international forum, as to the definition of the precautionary principle.	1.1706464262288656
What is more, if we reduce manufacturers' liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment.	1.0226182869111762
We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies.	0.8688525691783863
That would seem odd to me.	0.28413718309306424
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom, which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced.	0.9184629280195298
I think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility, provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds, but may only carry out part of the management per delegation.	0.8108601679435287
Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.	1.2721316257588584
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.	1.0888090224157998
You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had dealings recently.	0.9663508880211802
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General.	0.7259199914974256
Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.	1.2552632494634104
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.	0.7303555132245202
Madam President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet, despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued.	0.8546800717360772
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States.	0.7682056856006341
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.	0.9218207033253811
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement.	0.7168271840710334
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives.	0.8386116448516175
I would remind you that questions on the Minutes should refer to the Minutes.	0.7508403180532813
Helsinki was an historic event, an historic turning-point and an historic new reference point.	0.6688877204456238
The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo.	0.8072053519525293
However, it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one, and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve.	0.8202667264603566
Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	1.3633979279268076
Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma.	0.531040371158479
This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal, political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round.	0.8423853509599637
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings.	0.8654002592832319
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment.	0.6419891832454513
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union.	0.6836153797661998
In many ways, they share the same interests and the same insights.	1.0889465888807417
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents.	0.8043624050432422
It sounds good, saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge.	0.7553691442997743
The proposal, as formulated by the Council and subsequently amended by the Commission, provides for a convention based on three titles: the first lays down guidelines for ensuring the consistency of procedures and formalities for letters rogatory; the second lists a whole series of specific requests for mutual assistance and defines the formalities and procedures which must be followed in relation to these specific types of mutual assistance; the third and last provides for and codifies the procedures via which telephone conversations conducted by citizens in a State other than the one instigating proceedings can and must be intercepted.	0.9170927874032581
We understand that we also have a responsibility here, that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential.	1.0102975961806997
This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development.	0.9082998937013684
We must therefore act.	0.7441923192731185
We adopt legislation in the European Union.	0.5375836644012654
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding.	0.9405262456633506
. (SV) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report.	1.220338550611614
On behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible.	0.9356561519017882
These areas of our cities are often home to single-parent families, elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity, and families facing difficulties; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society.	0.6920289757427343
In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.	0.934515622104664
I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance.	0.4198554617146226
It looked, as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee, as if the Council understood the area of freedom, security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein, security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will.	1.0087365520362246
In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt, on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service.	0.6909644902146489
On the contrary, it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further. This is shown by the following figures: the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30:1 in 1960, 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997.	0.8685828805080111
The report that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula, taking up many of the amendments we have presented, still leaves room for a certain confusion, in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated.	0.884717348422404
Agriculture and health: we see the issue differently from the Commission: in our view there are no consumers: there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health, quality and respect for the environment.	0.9673799566583218
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December.	0.5613516624202893
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political.	0.8017503674339205
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda.	0.8839231153041331
I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently.	0.6758410660231149
For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management, and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation.	0.9465117931513228
Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	0.6129621130103844
We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.	0.6015239474665943
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable, given my thoughts on Amendment No 10.	0.8253769267773878
There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach.	0.7589815525925535
You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana.	0.8524305952740882
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution.	1.0466192515148585
Europe' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of Asia, the Far East and America.	0.6390682908344351
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment?	1.0250264912102265
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.	0.9201544700780537
Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.	0.6869839696297315
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise.	0.5371319959722934
Thirdly, I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important.	1.1675467540735456
We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions, but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary.	1.0333432116814418
I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation, taking strict account of free competition, because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future.	0.9013898351233817
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.	1.04064802557429
With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection.	0.7692934607001304
Parliament' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy.	0.9895452187376667
To continue would be economic suicide.	0.3454849795145212
Reforming the Commission	-0.0
In that area, there have been various policies from time to time, and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that, for ultimately superficial reasons, it may help to create banana republics elsewhere.	1.0783935056017342
I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.	1.010626425193384
But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.	0.9495473066243096
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo.	1.0799819285845471
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established.	0.7489673108163953
However, Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted, and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation.	1.1710074653481273
The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future, that leaves no room for foreign interventions, like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years, is a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the UN' s Security Council.	0.9819617900090156
The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland.	0.717668725639635
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument.	0.9655902744513615
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition.	0.754856606469394
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.	0.8595085995559524
Listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans, in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of Western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism, an individualism which, far from allowing people to flourish, paves the way for future dictatorship, in fact the worst kind of dictatorship, because those whom it enslaves are not even aware of their terrible servitude.	0.9706661812040964
On the other hand, it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination. This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful, as shown by the US precedent.	0.9562411623055709
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.	0.5287997164322835
In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium.	0.987107946277144
Last year' s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues.	0.7038661200802403
I am aware of the Commission' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November.	0.709401320104284
In my opinion, this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too.	1.1243753915945702
The EU should also, on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds, table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States.	0.829795689655961
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it.	1.234974289859172
The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party.	0.9685114563833559
The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future.	0.940575712026954
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.	0.7462233393116686
In short, we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other, because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results.	0.8692596144304281
(SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do.	0.8336464685803073
In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated.	0.9135308655215267
When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged.	0.9819583360568573
If we had considered these aspects in their overall context, then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden.	0.829739878325835
I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution.	0.5672781086116213
And if the aggressors include working-class people, all we can say to them is that, in acting in this way, they are digging their own graves.	0.9769397397347768
Question No 44 by (H-0020/00):	0.3493072130953091
I also know the particular problems in your constituency in Scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects.	0.6785900385097905
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital.	0.39314281404704826
These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95.	0.97897721297676
I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities.	0.91717037218233
It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships.	0.4078030491361403
As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million.	1.048032955256706
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.	1.1459180520323522
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured.	0.912197055042168
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting.	1.058057025646762
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	1.2085526608497066
The Commission is addressing a very important area, that is, commercial policy.	0.9429003193705425
Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed.	0.7389595171528534
That is certainly the view of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today.	1.116033942366218
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	0.9222582109681278
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one.	0.6596655363207048
I understand what you are saying.	0.8261336320136574
Today, scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction, and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay.	0.8794510562740486
We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim.	0.8408625475256339
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.	0.5979637775165225
The capital and securities market has continued to be developed.	0.6193969701245409
I also want at this stage to say that I was able to propose this initiative to the Commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague, Viviane Reding. This initiative was also established in conjunction with Günter Verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement, both its opportunities and risks, and of institutional reform.	1.0168753043045915
First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender.	0.7932918574472273
Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves.	0.9112357568337073
He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country.	0.7975034469970455
Once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union.	0.7710304081788752
The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States.	0.596780850285851
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information.	0.7374500423543948
Mr Dimitrakopoulos, transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions.	0.78182863462864
Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives.	0.7697578082583112
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem, it shelves it.	0.7692349070410955
These are questions which we should all be asking, but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations.	1.01830073099852
The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report.	0.7264407137095292
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel' s request, as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti?	0.6927886192704231
Mr President, I just want to take advantage of your welcome to the delegation by pointing out that the House also has the pleasure of welcoming the heads of the Austrian anti-racist associations who are honouring us with a visit.	0.8251040121863267
I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel' s report on the EQUAL initiative as I believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous NOW, HORIZON, YOUTHSTART and INTEGRA strands of the ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT initiatives.	0.7832116905522924
On 14 December 1999, a five year-old boy called Clément was found in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train, crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother.	0.62134014863649
I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary, by making commercial interests subservient to human rights, to which so much lip service is being paid.	0.940615365217672
In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources.	0.8265726170909808
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities.	0.9160844834878429
Mr President, this is one of the few occasions when, from what the speakers have said in this Parliament, from all sides of the House, there is clearly the greatest convergence of views on the Cyprus issue and, of course, on the pre-accession process for Cyprus and Malta.	0.9551981255560493
That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist.	0.8805801521876379
It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution, sale, rental, public reproduction and the making available of works.	0.7248221998856502
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability.	0.8891367012519419
In addition, car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use.	0.5533963934307168
It is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China - or Russia, for that matter.	1.0576935605822892
Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability.	0.4388684999450719
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation.	0.809952152512844
With the convening of the forthcoming IGC, the process of European Union is topical once again.	1.105361309229809
A very important component, to wit, one third of our drinking water, is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands.	1.0273559926820643
For example, the LIFE-Nature project in France, at Grand-Lieu Lake, planned without any coordination, led to a real ecological disaster, the de-silting operation which was carried out without regard for French law on the subject caused significant silting of the Acheneau, a water course located downstream, destroying spawning beds, filling wetlands, and who knows what else.	0.7035534229945815
Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one.	1.1615048252070403
The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk.	1.1544176068299576
But, Mr Marinos, in the EU context, culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agendas.	1.1598043078949938
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group?	0.8829546067146776
It is not an easy topic and, in my opinion, the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed.	1.0437992840889543
My second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward.	0.7732154199010011
In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind, not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner, but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted.	0.906673578804848
That would be more productive and I do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already overloaded being cut again and again because of this kind of show-piece.	0.8754715740875627
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.	0.6731503782118985
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.	0.7326104283952267
Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.	0.6868119746195407
We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report.	0.8775712274799992
The comprehensive approach that the Commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under Article 152 where Parliament will have a codecision function.	0.8316133937943867
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job.	0.8132984392379963
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.	0.645604790868513
We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well.	0.6068816479402537
What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call "le parcours du combatant", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment.	1.2016864364804984
I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court.	0.9821079513924649
For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January.	0.769309170879922
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities.	0.5187487937086364
Unfortunately, the positions taken by the Commission and the Council, or at least the presidency, are more than just a hair' s breadth apart; this is serious, especially in the light of the Council' s macho position on Austria.	0.9343251549075323
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax!	1.1545879586898253
This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances.	1.0289590821165753
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC.	0.6835182372906707
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.	0.6213170922231037
However, we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency.	0.8812576614988517
A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings.	0.664330109163315
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September.	0.5924544770681854
This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union, and especially within the framework of the Council.	0.9455157998159723
And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so.	1.0331395925996743
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people.	0.9534921632353067
We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: firstly, through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and, secondly, by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums.	0.9072859150231863
Often they are located together, each service being made more viable by the existence of the other.	0.789149376852535
We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties. Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions.	0.4940579816157835
There are, of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate, for example helping companies restructure.	0.6452748093521815
That is not what we want to do in Europe.	1.3095926682722283
Creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation, action to combat poverty, measures to assist low-income groups and old people, facilities for children, racial and ethnic integration, better opportunities for participation, a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures.	0.7243730458679386
We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission.	1.1194998878269629
Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example.	1.0503554406358147
I think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the European Union and Turkey have created a new backdrop, at Community level, which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two Cypriot communities.	1.1217057264471908
As regards the subject of flexibility, we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace, and at the thematic level where, for example, cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector.	1.0078635252624795
It will become totally invisible!	0.39712679324636296
Basically, the more we lose our grip on morals, the more we tighten our grip on our wallet.	1.0476124093878707
The Union should make a tax pact, which any countries could initially be party to.	0.7771936178503864
This is key as regards the future of this issue.	0.9904931330161918
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.	1.0467627645648512
There are, I believe, around 5 000 Kosovar political prisoners held in Serbia at the moment.	0.7832789476623834
I am proud to support such a resolution.	0.39244767007094367
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.	0.8047497293916499
We also argued this in November 1999, and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999.	0.9327273084789787
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms.	0.7771331443715568
Mr President, only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement.	0.8071113978995319
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might.	0.6585394395215854
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	0.7817614589438254
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you.	0.8230482000576357
After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table.	0.8518527413165383
However, the main concern remains ...	1.1207025319315604
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy.	0.6714704559050131
Quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation, be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council, or even on the part of the European Parliament itself, and some Members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development.	1.038331508452632
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same.	1.2896195573681972
At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions.	1.006078505501958
It is not easy to combine those aims. There is no obvious way.	0.9386905373972847
Policy on tourism is not, however, something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole.	1.0689272512272956
There is clearly a more ambitious goal.	0.8062038391640021
I do not wish to spend time right now, Mr Berend, going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed.	0.8316717473476081
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.	0.35999057985884386
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.	0.9581826902494055
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience.	0.5001029266568777
It is interesting for me, as a new Member of Parliament, to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation.	1.0833729846322597
The silt was in fact shifted 3 kilometres, at a cost of FF 6 million, the cure being worse than the disease, and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site.	0.951299705881297
It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on" .	0.8239673444987061
The truth is though, that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives.	0.8592496874906401
He is not always right, but in this case he is.	1.4455500363189526
The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations.	0.7541529751189162
Member States, i.e. national authorities, are responsible for implementing this strand. Finally, strand C organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under strands A and B and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development, subject to consultation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation.	0.8744863545539759
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments.	1.0010263932874128
Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs.	0.6544158884943903
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way.	0.8304542210790892
Like Mr Radwan, I am glad that Commissioner Monti is here rather than Commissioner Bolkestein because I believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition.	0.8177740353155486
However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different.	1.283247184000912
We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving.	1.0948704560595315
I am of the opinion - and luckily I am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens.	0.9378361489483811
Lastly, the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable.	1.190336454574698
In this, their second report, the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing. They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States.	1.104431117020751
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes, although this should be self-evident.	0.902071551620272
Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making.	0.7751755003594797
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles, one which are still, unfortunately, outside the European Parliament and the Commission.	0.9855473932799736
The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak.	0.43038020530485055
Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough.	0.6370341478097793
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.	0.7181622391166159
There is still much to be done, however.	1.2158251150060222
I saw some of Mr Kinnock's papers today, I heard some of what he had to say.	0.8529494606317362
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text.	0.9652347475189347
With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation.	1.241184815579816
We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission.	0.8202262609304847
To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff.	1.0218947028713161
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.	0.7954593960310439
There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.	1.0919182672913514
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management.	0.7174391826488471
Secondly, there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile, led by Ricardo Núñez, whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice, and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system, which is independent, is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against General Pinochet, concerning his crimes against humanity.	1.0029431935701907
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries?	0.5580652693049334
Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.	0.8420153109527369
It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.	0.9071952030842433
Has any thought been given to the matter?	0.6954866867523188
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States.	0.8013816592099191
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific.	0.958592436644545
In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised.	0.9779190955141719
The time has come, we feel, for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice.	1.1384211244184035
I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier.	0.9910912312149881
I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which needs no further comment: "Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected, defended and treated as such" .	0.9058839152971646
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon.	0.6287843937839326
Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations, leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests, the Spanish delegation of the People' s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the Spanish People' s Party and the Spanish Government, clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.	0.8595465345887814
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change?	0.6946662093038503
The proposal cannot therefore be approved.	0.3848815521149435
The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy.	0.9581143514600838
Mr President, earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment.	0.7199577483998152
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.	0.8911616333087927
On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.	0.91185880025923
This study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last.	0.7968374406907003
Another point: the coordination between INTERREG, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA.	0.7273513464693511
First of all, I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative, founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation.	0.8022205134010152
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this.	0.8562763576792096
President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with.	0.6845007783695131
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism.	0.8017666422428441
Certain isolated passages in the Commission' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries.	0.8635868079303651
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.	1.0159073236933422
Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse, as it did in 1987.	0.9563651709090912
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support.	0.5190676546300952
We have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring, often affecting the lives of large numbers of European people.	0.7112616033142674
Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians?	0.7248655833866916
Again, that will be a very demanding challenge.	1.19588211394565
One applies to the principle of treating people equally, without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. The other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin, religion, handicap or sexual persuasion.	0.8513716415771495
This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies, both private and public.	0.9290370361483431
My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica.	0.6694762379174396
In parallel, it can benefit from substantial financial support via the PHARE programme.	0.8790096121624308
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy.	0.8503933283217846
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	1.0822564933925785
I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.	1.0336151464759404
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it?	0.8400151433103454
We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.	0.9605307997387199
This means that we need a pressure instrument.	0.9005334632954667
I appreciate Mrs Cederschiöld' s work, and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the Tampere Summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied.	0.8480110917830157
I will end now.	0.6665046548580221
In this connection I should like to ask one of our Swedish MEPs for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of Sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution.	0.987153674551648
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case.	0.9436482404013142
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	1.223834928706269
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies.	1.0656795995693569
Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values, for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes.	0.7721541942482595
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.	0.9632091896079471
But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation.	1.0675371360896764
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this.	1.0604889596815825
The first is the issue of the media' s influence.	0.9197235686151317
It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world, in the form of this recommendation.	0.8504492651391281
This requires internal stability.	0.3017118753892473
In those circumstances, consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result.	0.9953982653174359
Obviously, the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.	0.9356462702163779
All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile.	0.9619879415625093

Everything has become more and more complex.	0.6283910979663427
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only.	1.0777677331231914
Commissioner, we shall continue to raise the issue, as Article 158, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.	1.2558001691444762
My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens' Amendment No 105.	0.9980753828578004
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term "self-employed" is concerned, the Commission will, as I have already remarked, provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged.	1.0377073275578086
We say that we want to protect human rights.	0.9970804751430404
I want to refer to the political position here.	0.6562390996130929
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused.	0.8268332752494959
Mr Medina Ortega asked me some very concrete questions.	0.40410127861774836
There is nothing new in your work programme.	0.9021989808934991
Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification.	1.1773146313096823
In 1995, a five-year derogation period was decided upon, which is now lapsing.	0.9709912591190812
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.	1.0300632821208213
The next step, i.e. institutional reform, will be taken following the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference, in which the European Parliament will be fully involved.	1.2647454627345907
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them.	0.7524144676567255
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies.	0.7313986901359574
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission.	1.041742451228506
The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building.	0.8925527340992505
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises, it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation.	0.85662519578644
In cases such as this, where there is uncertainty, simulators are used.	0.814539077926783
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.	0.835039863372183
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves.	0.9936934997369306
In my view, this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis.	0.9960586495274304
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned.	0.9303881980660934
To do so also changes the owner' s liability retroactively.	0.8400438613708247
Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.	1.2482999314351604
Furthermore, it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at Helsinki.	0.7667929586800623
Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means.	0.6480864750943066
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.	1.0648229203497697
We failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter.	0.6833727413172652
I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations, many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today.	0.838875557944343
Finally, a word on INTERREG.	0.9322813802813065
We are clearly, once again, returning to enlargement, which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security, peace and freedom.	0.7404755762169498
In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible.	1.11079898531812
In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly.	0.6867525944072576
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities, the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration.	0.8390382874633515
We are not doing a bad job of management.	0.8395765929700179
From this point of view, the common position is weak.	1.0450458644247835
We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.	1.1835641724621246
Let us remember that for half a century, Europe has provided us with peace, security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity.	0.9146676980214168
The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status, even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus, for example, by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos, is clearly encouraging Turkey' s intransigence.	0.7512670596373909
Consequently, consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production.	0.9046967245976261
Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance.	0.7788062329515096
This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and, what is more, desirable.	0.7927335742361727
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.	0.9186069173015095
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results.	0.8876379317354368
Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields.	1.0191144530129583

The matter is still open.	0.5139185094386991
Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?	1.048875592743023
Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993.	1.0893078104653402
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress.	1.327338622746492
As your rapporteur has requested, I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand.	0.918679158372135

But we have enough agreements now: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm el-Sheikh.	0.5240144133357857
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers?	0.8203938628140436
It is for this reason that, despite the many omissions in the text, the provisions set out therein could - and I say could, Mr President - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens.	1.1036523152535107
In the Member State where I come from, you are talking about 150 Guilders per car.	0.9097212798541834
Mr President, Mrs Karamanou' s question is an extremely serious one, and I would not wish to conceal that fact.	1.11737013578543
It would also appear to be in the Union' s interest for all Member States to help protect the euro, especially Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Greece, which will not be introducing the euro on 1 January 2002.	1.0736827179940676
This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home, and is resolving them with increasing success.	0.9864547592443801
Every statutory article should, of course, not just be judged on its regularity, but also on the importance of its contents.	0.9647184076866245
Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member.	0.8231795302384367
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs.	0.6606246446554614
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market.	0.9259366399443477
There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all.	0.8050609648329333

So tomorrow, if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs, this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable.	0.863644182252843
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.	0.9609802070139953
Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen.	1.1316462720458589
As a lack of coherence, one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk did, the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry.	0.5698867301203464
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.	0.8992920698211591
I know that this service is unprofitable.	0.8451505055572188
The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system.	1.0690752998819395
The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes.	1.0069900941503138
These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives.	0.8033992708680723
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions.	0.7517417937804576
On the contrary, we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes.	0.8345237641078213
Before the vote at the plenary sitting, new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee.	0.9180798339026288
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans.	0.8586062059127064
There is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home.	0.5747735613240843
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis?	0.8454510861447855
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.9341026596616595
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate.	0.7911421695850023
We shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing Albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region' s multi-ethnic nature.	0.7316528286659251
This may, of course, be seen as an issue concerning the internal market, but also as a public health matter for the whole EU.	0.9992698973580681
Your country filed an official application to join the Union in 1996 and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 1998.	0.7428307133078942
But, unfortunately, we are aware since Seattle that the Commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage.	1.0927105506772175
We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall.	1.3008542661425704
The Minutes of this sitting will be submitted for approval by Parliament at the beginning of the next part-session.	0.8315956281042383
The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development.	1.0332633690525743
Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	0.8912066031501058
The debate is closed.	0.14644257749373835
This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level.	0.7248752324057992
I think that is a very good idea indeed, and I fully subscribe to it.	1.328026647480038
At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well.	0.9406421257484426
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon.	0.8945598034868025
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat, for example, from Portugal, from Germany, from Finland, for heaven' s sake.	0.9572834588341395
Then the war came, and the observers were withdrawn.	0.8133153995719297
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do, in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change, to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.	0.9750035153839557
But that does not take away from the fact that the report' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon.	1.1253722372052442
The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls.	0.4754668557622411
Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.	0.6353461212936398
This is my first point regarding the policy.	0.8805985706409143
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them.	0.6341404584765395
I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support.	1.011161841839757
Mr President, public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion.	0.8765604958025728
Much remains to be done, however, and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe.	0.9606537431440804
I know that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, an important programme will be shown on Dutch television, in which an appeal will be made for observers. This is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on, so that at least a record can be made, not least for the future, for human rights committees, of what has been happening.	1.2048714692801747
We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi, for example, who has missed a great chance right from the outset, for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four, I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy.	1.0774304379663953
At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue.	0.7837481648414081
An essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect is that the cooperation with Member States and the industry and with other partners be as fruitful as possible.	1.1889907624722909
Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments.	1.13338412608861
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than: "It has not been done before".	0.8622157241673191
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted.	0.6337491492656359
I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website.	1.0872046617895146
It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press.	0.8770664448528045
At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system.	0.7408506327956423
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda.	0.8167438176870042
Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves.	1.2167661457063041
Need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February? I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are, of course, the representatives of the people in each Member State.	1.088745598458396
Mr President, I see two problems with this morning' s debate.	0.9443485319556033
We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism, both to local economies and as a factor of European integration.	1.0248603689572862
The results are certainly not what we expected.	0.8502697393719515
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets.	0.5550793811403745

Mr President, we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect.	1.0486615189726134
If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers.	0.9595020606938509
We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions, but so far we have had no working set of rules, as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises.	0.9326223229020265
A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed.	0.7191988589553866
And then we see that, increasingly, the regions, the various operators, businesses, associations, are submitting LIFE projects, both for LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT, projects that are of excellent quality, which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of European Union support, but we still cannot fund them, for lack of budget appropriations.	1.0453641465204482

(IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9942024828631238
That is how the common position has been worded.	0.8223220711955274
With the aim of working out a strategy, it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible, so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs.	0.820948333880301
Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme.	0.8370160084499845
Mr President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party in the European Parliament, I abstained in the vote on the EQUAL initiative because, although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination, its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific.	1.058242858942993
The current situation is not good.	1.0243484728716865
We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya.	0.627432112291524
But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.	0.7961519900083305
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this.	0.7765764226505701
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.18438377920338617
How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area?	0.8839618181580982
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises.	1.0040847823356636
As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases.	0.7339811635235175
Mr President, the American leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the Indians and other indigenous peoples.	0.7470023160275312
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.	0.8002066362055154
We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration.	1.1374080170769767
Mr President, Mr Monti, the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward-looking view to the Union' s enlargement.	1.2145122526228695
I thank them for their statements to the House.	0.6512102361980906
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations, although, I believe, these talks will not be held up indefinitely.	1.0613534438017562
They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts.	0.6206545165495119
In the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter.	0.9136894887308156
This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam, namely subsidiarity.	1.0015284367325321
Mr President, as a Member from one of the outermost regions, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives, URBAN and INTERREG.	1.1351893063215839
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?	1.0521888097644163

The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.5294750052930368
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.	0.9032404169320929
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.	0.7282287937690528
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty, dependency and alienation with equity, initiative and participation.	0.42750407416586894
Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of this House.	0.8152646842056378
In recent years, the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the Member States.	0.7504508371403755
On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles?	0.6512683749070515
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised.	0.9847083387656087
In addition, employment policy in general is also a factor.	0.9363982016243676
Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response.	1.0212495854286807
The Community' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars, which contradict the spirit of European unity.	0.7755159572030333
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	0.5828774682577023
When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late.	1.089167231160008
How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis?	0.7081273653779879
We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly.	0.6795894696074534
I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries.	0.7542757437596779
Mr President, I almost feel like saying, "Phew" , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work, and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz.	1.1375036854812077

I may have missed it in the list she gave out.	0.7618285238463512
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them.	0.920349115836405
Mr Medina Ortega, I naturally share your concerns and I can assure you that a coastal country like my own, the country currently holding the presidency, is naturally very concerned about this issue, all the more so as it does not have any oil tankers of its own.	1.0606397449404354
Naturally, there are good, capable employees in the Commission, and they are in the majority. But we need radical reform.	1.2758995068671497
We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks.	0.9045572942239194
That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country.	0.6527392212317067
This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself.	0.9437244746896744
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation.	0.6253718464760925
Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice.	1.1113687523504296
As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime.	0.9531624675640238
If there is, we have generated it in this House in the past year.	1.3921601850454635
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us.	0.8161058253760046
Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies.	1.0737133156379621
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.	1.001004193295425
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.	1.116203091780676
Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky' s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, inter alia, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances.	0.9742834697299659
This was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the First World War of Africa, given the involvement of certain countries in others.	0.6769921629393332
Mr President, it became known this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have insulted the king and prime minister.	0.7419235828921753
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question.	0.855289849218879
In many cities in France and England there are now slums, breeding grounds for many sorts of problems.	0.6026977615591043
Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public.	1.1789070163873336
It is good that URBAN is to continue, as it has had good results at local level.	0.9275535369478859
There is no contradiction between the two.	0.8263828541043492
So far, as you know, this has proved unsuccessful, and I have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary.	1.0808960110236856
In particular, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 88 and 102.	0.7284382499228318
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B: 'integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions' , so as to cover, in what I think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions.	0.8130291962394071
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget.	1.0807885209362125
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States.	0.47065525000628095
The labour market is also changing.	0.5038551807530761
The fact is, showing solidarity with Eastern Europe, is all very well, but it is not enough.	1.0064184805184495
As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets.	0.44610738014535617
The months of NATO bombardments of Kosovo and the mediation attempts in the Middle East are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in Africa.	0.6279726123976447
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.	0.6481511644599034
It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena.	0.9935249872076914

The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees.	0.9062508052497535
However, local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that 'partnership' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance.	0.5314899082938098
It is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism, when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism.	0.7651211105813663
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that.	1.1784564454527127
This is where Mr Solana, the High Representative to the Council, could come into his own.	1.0712148252119853
Those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater.	0.5893031612424038
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.	0.8696082495412665
We cannot leave it simply to governments.	0.43046304047076905
In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.	1.261184961413841
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome.	1.2246780271148388
I will give you one example of this.	0.6688389102823661
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept, Amendments Nos 3, 12 and 13.	0.8835976953760661
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise.	0.8703165821758497
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice.	0.7548105160355284
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs.	0.745879280123091
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents.	0.7187101537574756
That seems to me to be rather too long.	0.7326339778957817

In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government' s agreement, ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire.	0.863022210170155
In France it has had enormous resonance, particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty.	0.89317651391398
In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid.	0.664012810860792
That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition.	0.9026490977492097
Thank you, Mr Davies.	0.9463526654456993
In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.	0.8195872495068568
The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies.	0.9004583839685383
Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mr Gargani, for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also, considerably difficult.	0.8952177704071776
UCITS are a success story within the European Union.	0.5163716840411567
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.	0.9157956367163184
Every year, I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund, that they are far behind in spending the funds.	1.2790954404558301
Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict.	0.8449764726942898
So when we talk now about the need to involve the Northern Cyprus community in exchanges of information, particularly with a view to the eventual accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we need to be aware that we are trying to find practical formulas that will enable us to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of a political solution.	1.0000043651596535
We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance.	0.7983012488525704
It would seem to us that the Council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions, the rights of the defence, the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally empowered to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly.	1.1315496275980448
Once again, there is active participation from groups from the private, public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region.	0.7824351090991088
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.	0.8460176687202399
Fifthly, to publish an annual scientific, technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out.	0.7969214517637153
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion, to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union' s regional policy.	0.98193583827894
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.	0.781356854046637
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers. Far from it.	0.5861693971186677
Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe.	0.9920467858373293
Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender?	0.6698568113163533
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for?	0.8795909933643767
The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the Council.	0.7430676443655212
I might also ask: when do you anticipate that they will be in place?	0.95809708823218
In any case, the Council' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime.	0.9709929284647292
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report.	0.9662304340714558
For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price.	1.115731173202518
As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office.	1.1063097832574318
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	0.5073074884294395
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes, namely, the new INTERREG III initiative, EQUAL and the LEADER+ scheme.	0.9387209654187891
We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated.	0.8582492909471674
We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror.	0.8506625909407302
First of all, as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out, it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle.	0.9876357793524255
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means.	0.670589618328
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere.	0.6755282027699098
What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies.	0.9792062088392436
The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020, the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020.	0.8575474282585764
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate, by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers.	0.8559091793034062
I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power.	1.0880879951478197
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else.	0.8464733868360739
But, listening to you, Commissioner, we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992, I believe, the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee.	1.0135426507184606
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded.	0.7929842782819209
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative, the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue.	1.3863721771539361
However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them.	0.7735128794971217
There is nothing to indicate that the Member States' legal principles, legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting. Nor, in the light of the international convention of 20 April 1929, can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases.	0.8771056989685733
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties.	1.0629187143965002
I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed, that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority, by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries.	1.019522720433301
I hope that we can thrash this out.	0.8721046825000627
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.	0.8965794778355753
The European Council in Helsinki had the courage to take certain decisions, and I believe that various aspects of these decisions have already recognised the real value of these opportunities which, as I said at the beginning of my first speech, represent a window of opportunity.	1.0062999514464133
Accordingly, we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG.	1.0766852556566469
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.	0.7708524625604916
Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 34, 36, 38, 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer' s liability.	0.5479458178254744
In my view, it is clearly in conflict with, and far exceeds the scope of, Article 34, paragraph 2, point b where a legal basis is established for so-called framework decisions which are binding upon the Member States in regard to the desired objectives, but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation.	1.0855152969759345
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values.	0.9900809622490045
We estimate that the Commission' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer.	0.911976676279131
In the grand scheme of the directive, it is perhaps a minor point, but nevertheless a disputed one.	0.818657804407906
We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens, decision makers and authorities.	0.7783024616136204
Despite the fact that the Community, through the structural funds among others, injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe, these disparities continue to exist.	0.7506124591300796
It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust.	0.9344208588866165
Once the project comes to an end after five years, the policy of free gifts also ends.	0.8907494631566759
Secondly, for economic and monetary union.	1.0090978250884342
There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation.	1.1340456813308049
Hence the need for the most coherent European human rights policy possible, which of course means that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous positions where we consider a state of affairs to be unacceptable, and I have in mind, in particular, the references that many Members have made to China.	1.0266752815518445
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU.	0.7423935321962447
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II.	0.6031772556382726
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system.	0.8059984556711565
Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament.	0.9506503140563176
Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry!	0.7232186269441266
Because what is it that unites us in Europe? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, more than anything.	0.8340515964605629
The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders.	0.6361967607327036
A number of obstacles remain, but I am convinced that, as the legislative work progresses, we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of.	0.9804166385841983
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan.	0.9690585384777431
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.	1.0758059622256735
On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, we can support the Commission' s proposal on Mr Böge' s report, but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur.	1.0708119647180714
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.	0.8620267441420184
Mr President, I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.	0.9641765407392884
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas.	0.3864533698691512
In the meantime, however, as has already been mentioned, the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded.	0.9754486480536612
No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say.	0.7610240918464353
With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect, are to a large degree covered by LIFE.	0.8983735203548906
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees, the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 22.	0.827962636036588
I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission' s officials, which has been quite excellent.	1.285252042509082
It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed.	0.6083808656486391
We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque, but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person.	0.7781183060604366
Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent.	1.17404063593754
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations.	1.0445915501953595
I can only warn you against consenting to this.	0.5915593522119388
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.	0.9020257558074789
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians.	0.9886815765490329
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.	0.9079523050405413
What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie.	0.8553811678748743
And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland.	0.6572904531359879
Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary.	1.1284696859615875
The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House.	0.8460735515528145

Could the Commissioner answer two questions.	0.33894910343800216
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.	0.8461637719190713
Madam President, we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as, fortunately, are a great many other Members too.	1.0011206048684183
How strongly is the single market established at the moment?	0.8761866208783466
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.	1.0887155198672223
Appropriate messages about the health effects of AIDS must be delivered to primary school children by teachers who are comfortable with the information that they are trying to communicate.	0.5298465619465119
We support these critical remarks, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd, against this background, to vote in favour of approving the accounts.	0.9709446494229633
Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically.	0.9320859987163832
Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will.	1.0952242121211322
In this way, the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good, to benefit the poor not just the wealthy, the many not just the few.	1.0783717742355665
However, the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper.	0.9562210817399212
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.	0.9797983717532547
In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties.	0.859916099207907
There is a Paris Memorandum in existence, let me remind you, which stipulates a minimum for inspection, that is, one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned.	0.9290035173257724
The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan.	0.7023602770305087
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage.	0.8098237830973052
We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved.	1.079640301224446
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	0.9366565232713376
The environment is still the poor relation in the European budget, even though it is primarily an investment.	1.2215493856536725
You will understand, Mr President-in-Office, that there was a point to my question, because the Council is a political body of the European Union and the citizens of Europe, men and women, want to know how it views the democratic and social model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	1.0103694874274092
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee, all concerning state aid.	0.8098463976438228

I know that you, as Members of Parliament, in your own regions and countries, are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers, as one Member of Parliament said, go to make a vast multicoloured carpet.	1.278786332650044
Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction.	0.5728154069045104
So far there have been no infringements of the law.	0.6230822865363114

Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.	0.8913290539937138
Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions.	0.8941758209953129
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level. This gives the citizen a sense of recognition, here in Europe and elsewhere.	1.0111746394872891
Yet I believe that, as this debate has shown, we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas.	1.2234455818172567
In the Union, sugar is produced from sugar beet.	0.5440603014308608
In order to compensate for this situation, the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us.	1.0976093462944185

I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless.	0.8474891081577812
Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government.	0.6004415916176594
We will, in conclusion, vote against this report, while stressing that the Europe to which we aspire is a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion, as well as very serious examination.	0.8338818812727857
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy.	0.4825081204505392
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil slick, the seventh since 1967, shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.	0.7739704433730218
At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified.	0.9622736438478245
The terrorist organisation ETA has, in its time, killed police officers and soldiers.	0.7841759913607523
I would also mention the right to develop. It is the right of all peoples who, in turn, are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that, most importantly, is full of hope and personal growth, within each individual society.	1.1287734889315861
We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad.	1.1169190609574704
The European Union has condemned the use of anti-personnel landmines and we are supporting de-mining operations through an international NGO.	0.8547131336815406
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases!	0.9800070241611384
It is thanks, too, to Parliament' s action, preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale.	0.7609253801642408
Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.	0.8819823898845843
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.	0.7583823599730707
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.	0.9759558524973035
In Nassau, we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba.	0.7723608634644734

Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.	0.6406754496014329
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation, and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject.	1.0843886299073215
Today' s problems cannot be solved in five years.	0.5862155743347564
I am stressing this point because, when disasters are being reported daily in the news, we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done. Then, in our haste, we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time.	1.0080771669848778
So I welcome it as such.	0.45995376206913074
This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten, Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict.	0.9970458855202228
The UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this.	0.5658338413190647
We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community, but too many: national, European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there, there is the Court in Luxembourg.	1.004486924267278
Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.	1.1270686797547682
This is perhaps an appropriate moment to welcome to the official gallery, a delegation of four members of the Moroccan parliament, led by Mr Brahim Rachidi, Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives.	0.722553587441743
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference.	1.0154851950526902

Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays.	0.48603684981025186
Madam President, an omission appears to have been made. In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out, no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE, ELDR, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux.	0.9922792571630648
My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women.	0.8610779288509611
There is one final issue I would like to raise.	0.7139990029176427
I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschiöld' s recommendation, which is an excellent paper, but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed.	1.0752669890927098
I would quote Gaza as an example.	0.7223380497395107
It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions.	0.8986755127667188
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.	0.9631637608586693
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document.	0.5068928727687156
Honourable Member, I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law.	0.8356689332437115
Indeed, what right do we have to demand of developing countries that they give their minorities a voice, that they protect their valuable natural areas and that they respect human rights, if it transpires that we are unable to meet these demands in our own countries?	1.087133786755382
The answer to this is that we know very little about this.	1.0729855190657451
In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established.	1.0899745555899734
Clearly, the importance of tourism for the economy of regions traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, southern regions for example, is very different, and should be studied carefully.	1.065591739855432
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone.	0.7064913123514959
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step" .	1.11237605747515
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.	0.9848957410185827
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	0.9438740072524001
Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries.	0.7766822994766105
We do not play at political correctness in this House: we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the Council over a period of time, and which the European Commission has also followed carefully, attentively and pragmatically.	1.1403834029642763
Thank you for the presentation.	0.9987885053203669
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.	0.9408300374674208
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning, since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this.	0.9713767710180858
Indeed, it is in line with some thirty Russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge.	0.6123067205299269
As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety.	1.1074675775456178
So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.	1.1018960676057492
Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly.	1.5841434881592176
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.	1.026309169483109
Finally, once this legal basis to which many of us aspire has been established so that a common tourism policy can be developed, we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment, as proposed by the Commission with the support of this House. In this strategy, young people and women, training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention.	1.112988685139647
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do.	1.0480504468458798
The public must have a right to clean water.	0.8262894909180925
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed.	0.9090103523632272
Madam President, I voted in favour of the Schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because, as I stated in this Chamber this morning, I consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the European Union be put to good use.	1.1370181282557064
I certainly appreciate that.	0.40848956190408053
It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme.	1.09162368546658
Finally, we, as British Conservatives, are looking for a change in direction, towards the development of an independent competition authority.	1.2439081860794785
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model.	0.5008678877814267
And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind, I am pleased to be present here today, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us.	0.8463137118893791
We therefore assume, Commissioner Byrne, that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base.	0.9348866922404354
Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level.	0.764256124573635
In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.	0.8821233590321418
We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance.	0.6978135349531354
The polluter ought to pay.	0.5521320913769264
People must realise this!	0.24695274143961038
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them, because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes.	0.8969868125215393
It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy.	0.9981961399888997
I would also like to say a few words on Africa, Madam President.	0.7976383585543644
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform.	0.6897031086673738
To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.	1.2375912350906908
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon.	1.1740060433656763
What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital?	0.7402782497779629
However, I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State.	0.9494818599869896
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?	0.8210733047377576
In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like.	0.6283929461778139
It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war.	0.4672368176062105
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events.	0.7979225606528189
First and foremost, I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years.	0.9945629736893373
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage.	0.6811446639165117
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.	0.5208597298614054
In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia.	0.6038549991298648
Have the lessons not been learnt?	0.4758236523504914
The amended text will then read, and again I must read it in English, which is the lingua franca of our Parliament: 'transferable securities issued by over the counter derivatives dealt with' , etc.	0.7846104743699012
On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime.	0.9782560032290901
In spite of everything, all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society, and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation.	0.9492806861899183
I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome.	0.984581986298243
There are alarming reports of human rights violations.	0.49789167932794465
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years.	0.8092067195932796
The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted.	1.0997338388272198
In such cases, there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers, thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy.	0.7344187655731862
Subsequently, if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised, then I will do this.	1.0995187998624998
A better solution would be, as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism suggests, strengthened coordination between LEADER+ and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes, such as INTERREG, PHARE, SAPARD or MEDA.	0.7631581611768476
Mr President, rapporteur, restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us.	1.1472311025117539
Europe is a community of law.	1.0167767639580942
People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.	1.0462564235146485
Mr President, Commissioner, Director-General, I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report: I welcome the Commission' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules, and to propose practical reform measures.	0.9540861541634814
A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.	0.785060695065009
The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7%.	0.4232875526388597
The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate.	1.0244069126817557
Now, I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric.	0.9245875760689919
In connection with this, we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well.	0.9418326198745135
The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies, because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate.	1.0101235025156483
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock.	0.8724258847587605
In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore ...	1.2191484165923778
Lastly, in today' s vote on our four amendments, two have been approved and the other two rejected.	1.1067888395870595
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code.	0.9767432746980448
The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years.	0.5588941989533134

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented.	0.6308719829290392

Financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001. It will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process.	0.9733548638467304
Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe.	0.852470933279531

We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality.	0.7486803521765237
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do.	0.7944715574618988

One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was, rightly, the establishment of this type of tax, and this is not by chance.	1.1050049517005418
I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities.	1.0594587672609204
For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.	1.1874553523332503
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria.	0.908021534238866
We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions.	0.7303215159795539
We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it.	0.7625128448900673
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.	0.6085641593619818
Have we achieved results?	0.402779236026565
For example, the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne, in France, have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today.	0.6419126996402013
We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside.	0.9172999832941247
In other words, our rapporteur is proposing an oral amendment to add a recital reading: 'Whereas Malta and Cyprus will participate...'	0.8518856966138377

Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance.	0.6218421532563507

Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand you have a point of order.	0.9157576373454709
We have recently had cause to talk about the 'polluter pays' principle. We should apply this principle rationally and calmly, correctly targeted and without ideology.	0.7697450650161173
I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help.	1.2299820082159902
This applies both to the post and other sectors.	0.9070420025895868
Mr President, first and foremost, I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment, both surface water and groundwater, is probably one of our most important duties of all.	0.8927237841610686
In addition, at a time when Europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights, there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is.	1.0204524883343629
It is, to a large extent, a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance, where, in particular, strategic coordination by the public authority is essential, even though it has been modernised.	0.9982324761347978
Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow Members.	0.9110359102868371
In addition, investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund.	0.5220394025582189
It is an integral part of the tension, inherent in the very concept of European integration, between solidarity and cooperation between Member States, with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy, and competition, which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity.	1.0085056047602579
In my view, as far as China is concerned, and knowing that the European Union' s policy towards China has been a total failure, allegedly constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or, worse, it has given the Chinese new pretexts for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms (as Mrs Wallström has said with regard to the Internet) in all sectors, in Tibet, in inland Mongolia, in eastern Turkistan.	0.8860476908071427
Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement.	0.8271766314778854
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation.	0.3227657586647159
Most people, however, would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised, if they were given the chance to, in other words, if there was work there.	1.3433939580145822
This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting.	0.6176648768971877
If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before.	0.9460335160353704
Furthermore, the cloud of debt remains an obstacle to real development.	0.6026887244462847
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment, the source of so much despair, if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds.	0.9770041292183419
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done.	0.8692970207720757
We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.	0.8569835663131014
This is not your first visit to our Parliament, Mr President.	0.8912441482292448
Therefore, more than making amendments, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done, apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews, especially in relation to the age of the different vessels.	0.9338406899200387
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors.	0.9143003623684592
Subject: Commission's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme, setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue'.	0.9858410753143704
It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid.	1.2806366634852924
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say?	1.1255641804748193
Madam President, you spoke about fundamental political values, and one of the fundamental political values, even more important than democracy, is respect for others.	1.275163475928949
Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate.	1.2585899223762231
In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators.	0.9795996426611656
Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Liikanen' s words, and I am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because, although the subject is broad in scope, it also concerns a specific fact.	1.1824928681782634
But I do wonder what his own view is on this.	0.8077617297030429
We are not trying to deceive anyone and we are in no way trying to use practical solutions to create a model implying political recognition.	0.8638340372358851
Subject: Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming).	0.6261871920774973
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities.	0.6983041287582613
It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo.	0.7692275433642819
The Commission is committed to a universal postal service, as the European Parliament has shown on several occasions, the postal service is actually, as some speakers have already mentioned, a key factor in social and territorial cohesion.	1.2809872043744375
Does that not say a lot about management ability?	0.6574221112437387
I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity.	0.7219667416958355
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin for action, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.	1.0232144576439064
Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive.	0.9976315640585273
We already have, on the international side, plans in place to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on.	0.8065254563631674
Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN' s resolutions and, in exchange for peace and security, hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967?	0.7327846132948898
However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.	0.7142223422294415
A simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source.	0.347646559744063
There must, of course, be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups.	0.8739557560317401
This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence.	1.0658636468547542
Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible.	0.7154711660296295
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President.	0.7244115089609745
I do believe that reform with all it implies, including the new mechanisms, will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind.	0.7350835575641349
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.	0.8511612994112836
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten.	1.3717963518510816
The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet?	0.8571743145876058
However, we are unable to agree to the text of the report, although I welcome the work carried out by Mr Schmidt, for several reasons.	1.1710338096961805
Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs.	0.9059815571428905
Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation.	1.0204950606866863
I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion, there will be no cohesion at all, only disunity.	0.7968335473843834
The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council, nor even to the European Parliament, but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.	1.1751747346388894
I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.	1.1668098959930482
In particular, we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the Commission' s becoming involved in telling the Member States what to do (see, for example, paragraph 7).	0.8385374729721684
We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position.	0.8362381445418796
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.	0.9230115063797784
And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark.	1.0950670931236677
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis.	0.8215874345543874
It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies.	0.6623973322595642
What is to be done with this money?	1.1049366800308347
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found, and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens were almost the authors of.	0.8629319772467956
In order to remove these causes, one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question.	1.0962639823566271

For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country.	0.6769527599632946
In other words, we should not establish conditionality, or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start, but, nevertheless, we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage.	1.233653065171563
(Parliament agreed to the oral amendment) - Relating to Amendment No 9	0.8240029305332478
This is a false debate whose aim is purely political, and has no basis or technical viability.	0.9272342445908193
I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this.	1.096692787570041
But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination. That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau.	1.131519858435944
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.	1.125434934914356
They see a never-ending series of local wars. They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves.	0.7052712287864351
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied, it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably.	0.8667047716260694
These costs are not very high.	0.7303254328030626
First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: "The future of social protection" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk.	1.0248574596210795
. (SV) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy, human freedoms and rights, and a social market economy.	1.010574686635513
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo.	0.7733023397229012
Madam President, I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about.	1.2522410797596923
As yet, we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed, but one thing I can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably.	1.230812304362096
If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it.	0.8674283055074032
There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs, allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain.	0.5146362568243668
We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history.	0.7671370299911277
I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going.	1.0136956960667698
The common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the European Union. This is the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 37 other Members.	1.2005737958552163
We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	0.6633756326670953
Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource.	0.9076951039136655
It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March.	0.9395478603228647
This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China' s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States' initiative.	0.9899614275137298
The entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union, because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect, and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States, including associated countries, are of vital importance in order to reach this number.	1.0165468853789918
However, the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project.	0.9858551287262456
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will.	0.8337914254963386
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too.	0.5717144640780485
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	0.42012288763726324
In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia.	0.9580002439392001
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation.	0.33745535114596786
Both branches adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confers implementing powers on the Commission.	0.7785113124612543
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities, in general terms, are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years.	0.8695234689531106
Are these reports accurate?	0.3159623234499116
Unfortunately, it was then changed, and changed for the worse, which turned it into a document which in fact, proposes something that we cannot accept.	1.0767252612978964
Mr President, I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible.	0.7695186623612479
However, in order to give this new approach some chance of success, the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal, a more simple and direct one, involving the NGOs from the outset, so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way.	1.0173023383123714
In reality, the motive underlying the increased interest in the Tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic.	0.7891860373574283
The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many.	0.8936763899371509
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten's report.	0.48227581307212564
That is not the sort of postal service that we want.	1.0244743544203356
Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more.	1.1546351961173709
For all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria.	0.9789261178555756
If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission' s intentions.	1.2603215571734374
It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks, so as to protect individuals, society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations.	0.6906993286804656
Mr President, Commissioner, I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years. I was therefore aware how the situation was developing.	0.8686119850614509
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.	1.030107801692454
This is also reflected in many of Parliament' s amendments.	0.9441944556267772
These developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting.	1.0345951901094423
An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe.	0.9896037396767761
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance.	0.7355258138675276
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.	1.087988447225081
I would, therefore, ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups.	0.7222524051242123
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.	0.657491312815339
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions.	1.1741664528015152
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.	0.7574518395996602
These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found.	0.821451072315578
Of course, every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case.	0.7275212004335737
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future.	0.7463079351335395
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.	0.9522137580934378
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role, even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States.	0.8831070033543003
We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there.	0.9883505017714965
Over the next seven years, the Commission' s proposals concerning URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit.	0.8743507191749017

Far too often, artificial fertiliser, veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge.	0.5841456858863443
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end?	0.7315525716600767
In the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity, which is scarce in some areas, while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use, to those who live in drought areas.	0.9783358415628143
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.	0.9988698481543897
Assessment and publication are part of this, and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past.	1.0234053401868057
Still relating to Thursday' s sitting, the PPE Group has requested that Mrs Cederschiöld' s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda.	0.897378021525701
I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned.	0.9817048129264748
I think we need to retain it.	0.8538176352480522
The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all.	0.5738731765945937
Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable?	0.9612250045331726
There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women.	0.6661711445340929
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.	0.8759001696528336
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car.	0.6582749836733068
If the Commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards, no one doubts that it would present it without delay.	0.7803570304666809
Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate.	0.7084822394927761

Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.	0.9312414195286569
In fact, the word seems to have been banished from the Commission' s vocabulary, whereas liberal and American references abound.	0.9349429415944283

Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House' s discussions, because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length.	1.0220347469855033
The goal of the Commission' s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection.	1.203383060111638
A crucial point is that rules are proposed for so-called simplified prospectuses.	0.7323249463601711
In view of this growing interest, the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle.	1.1755456702699012
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density.	0.8741202563375392
I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score.	0.513257173859173
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach.	1.0080719176538422
The destructive effects of the CAP and EMU on the balance between regions, especially on the vitality of the more rural, the more remote and the least populated regions, is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a sinecure, far from it.	0.8848012850902196
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country.	0.8761020616786797
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.	0.8532702071188729
Although a few other groups have been mentioned, it is the Member States, in particular, which are on the lookout.	0.9680085121125904
It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union. Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies.	0.9174995208424864
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.	0.7775904783752388

No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again.	0.8224949036547862
The Commission did not do that.	0.4986813363973806
But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.	1.3756191536503484
This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe.	0.7395460906279424
I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.	0.9597006689334215
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament, Mr Gasòliba.	1.0617308763436415

These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.	1.0886968749417996
I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge.	0.4834835234977362
Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price.	0.757556344411272
Hurricane "Lothar" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -, but to switch to the precautionary principle, under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too.	0.7887367879611704
Now, a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament.	0.9732689481022704
This will determine the success of our work.	0.8481004271498088
Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology.	0.8825586787417414
This was followed by a second period, in which the worth of female models was recognised.	0.7353415603415666
I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last.	1.0872399887272324
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.	0.8374376732013897
Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit.	0.6342833407305204
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.	1.3178977257487574
Thank you, Mr Zimmerling: If I am informed correctly, this is the first time you are addressing this House.	1.0749013127705054
Question No 5 by (H-0785/99):	0.3636812943407792
A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers.	0.6123238919930655
In the field of immigration, borders and asylum, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database, and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families, as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union.	0.9416427033521776
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed.	0.646685835466631
What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party, which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals, via Vandam and Agusta?	0.7637438478579899
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.	1.0941996730535675
However, I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals.	0.9967067161279223
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species, of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year.	1.088382684018154
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples.	0.8420224781691726
I would like to remind you of one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here.	0.9763648926492434
The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court.	0.7393849717195775
No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life.	0.8942747698427295
The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies.	0.8072205578843192
First, it leans too far towards products based on indexes which have no bearing on the real economy; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz referred to just now.	0.7443148003070514
In the last 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: firstly, total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading; secondly, annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350, that is, 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation.	0.664639158358128
Some may be better than others, and some worse.	0.8654806981039274
But when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category, an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable sampling in abattoirs using such tests can provide useful pointers in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and, basically, where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis.	0.8986551819518027
Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday.	0.9845863380862332

The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions.	0.8817792824455077
My urgent request, which has been echoed many times in resolutions, is the following: could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas?	0.9628683216347679
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.	1.0369028491976744
This Parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible.	0.9696900778733055
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	1.1106212784175045
However, because of the Council' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 (pre-accession) in the Financial Perspectives, the European Parliament agreed, by way of exception, and I stress that it was by way of exception, that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 (external action) of the Financial Perspectives for the year 2000.	1.164626808927403
Does section 11(1) conceivably authorise the following practice.	0.4519207532888776
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation.	0.477580456700137
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible.	0.9323195558767268
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?	1.0043726796524712
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing.	0.8170237793179871
Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.	0.9248354673629731
Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason.	0.6905438755521166
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.46935302058080963
I should like to ask the House to wake up, at long last, to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment, not the yobs, bears full responsibility.	1.144019207922915
Unfortunately, we have recently witnessed the eradication of Serb, Romany, Turkish, and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next.	0.9792386306094953
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.	1.0656241859173803
Mrs Frahm, the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9303246348691621
"We do not have the wherewithal for that," they said.	0.9630565080710808

The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about.	1.2349231122490858
It is therefore political by nature.	0.7381117211819732
In rural areas, for many years, even before the Irish Free State came into existence, we sometimes had this service of a post office.	0.8807439308932572
The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not, however, tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000.	0.5623230791438438
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.	0.946352780554499
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council.	0.56947773474712
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully.	0.9023969340806539
I can, therefore, only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended. We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems.	0.8831833401605136
Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.	0.8697169945174377
It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new, unfamiliar notes.	0.9496888638054064
The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture, environment and water resources, and between positive and negative effects, and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on. This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards, along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income.	0.7431812594328958
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open, democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve.	0.7488079028201003
Most of Parliament' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious.	0.747214359140381
Also, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such, thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions.	0.7911358116840008
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period.	0.6421538671259099

I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions.	0.8079282017653813
We can see in the incumbent operators, in public post offices, a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers' needs continues.	0.8165940781240452
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based, by means of the INTERREG initiative, on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent.	1.1294316856050022
At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments.	0.7004034013323311
The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party.	0.7854082956777314
It is concerned with increased integration which, as part of a duplicitous package, involves increased repression and control.	0.8242513516164104
When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.	0.86382371643718
Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia.	0.9165874091129343
It is not enough just to say, "You, the murderers, please stop the slaughter!"	0.9084631387305034
The measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective, and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection, environmental policy, transport policy, taxation policy, etc., which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult, since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them.	0.9049480360132541
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union.	0.626172584213668
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III.	0.7093728014218172
In that case, the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity.	0.7280406782370955
By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.	0.996026662857184
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be, particularly as regards security, crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level.	0.6707965227472299
We shall now proceed to the vote.	0.21099585010953759
The debate is closed.	0.05158099740982336
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.	0.9283680492978468
Mr President, I seem to recall from my study of European history, that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job.	0.7639385824651348
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe.	0.47213071037280574
For us this is straightforward: in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars.	0.8584998584577137
Both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are, as such, a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome.	0.917725918833235
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.	0.8288122827937113
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority.	0.5975801650216153
It is our responsibility as a parliament, particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union, to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament.	1.161681882205874
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose.	0.7894153509007845
It is about keeping communities together.	0.6484525122112167
Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order.	1.0209374715217994
I am far keener to see us move away from today's car, weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km, to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg.	0.6237387758374111
In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy.	0.820684666413682
I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government.	0.909232772042468
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers.	0.5736294745405056
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper.	0.9793239109563119
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid.	0.9360082057112578
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	0.8034377976614109
I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda.	1.1432762521295528
Madam President, it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before.	0.9598981940838713
The Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work.	0.8853132842075533
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside.	0.7675617445256456
I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein.	0.6808180341728461
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	0.3947181161214119
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal' s point of view.	1.0446418801132902
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case.	1.0883899882034238
Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology.	0.8760367801227429
Within my group, it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon.	0.8590962334971337
Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision.	1.1108235531233301
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects.	0.7039002680272122
The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve.	0.8910073388163552
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all.	0.6903535939950651
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.	0.8392979199810513
The Lomé Convention is a unique partnership; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lomé and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora.	0.8211423427164786
Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds.	1.3131622058622343
I urge the Chinese again to do so.	0.6567640174711419
This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortunately not there.	1.120454781214319
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems.	0.6821444576915406
But this directive has never been transposed into national law.	0.6341984991257338
Indeed, Minister, we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract.	0.8906151306187267
We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts, such as the Mediterranean countries, and countries with northern levels of rainfall.	0.8045707048858005
I want to mention, as has already been mentioned by many speakers today, that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the EU during the next two decades.	1.2287732949122692
In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.	0.9013606142855747
In this respect, we are faced with the most sensitive issue: what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems?	0.838852033442197
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts.	0.7813765002251782
Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.	1.09468902629715
Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later?	0.935746259100648
Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life.	1.003764015501924
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	0.8903607716914521
There should be no confusion in this debate. As environmentalists, we do not want an excuse for a motion.	1.1606996285920248
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).	0.7221061908451432
In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism.	0.8903622764760304
This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit.	0.7363890945183259
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money.	0.6264907764531231
I suggest to the Commission, as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement, to present a document, that explains the value of enlargement, not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense; a document, like the Cecchini report before the Single Act, that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand, historic challenge facing Europe today.	1.056141797535787
The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy.	0.6142919473439028
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	0.4689461419485408
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge, and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people' s health.	1.053420062376274
All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels.	0.7321638392967043
Subsidies, monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike.	0.6328478431643536
The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem.	1.0966101857196695
Mr President, the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNO reminds us of the fact that, 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, nearly 40% of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers, heavy weaponry is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present, in total violation of the resolutions by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter.	0.9378832891229506
Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU' s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group.	0.8811991098641554
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe.	1.1938300193710265
However, the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these.	0.9469354230238998
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures.	0.9063704636858868
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.	0.9550921916000157
Now, the concept of "uniform harmonisation" is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question. It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as "it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security.	0.9417848571450845
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.	0.83330980275083
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment, as well as the transfer of territories.	0.7882839410107679
Lastly, I would like to assure you, Mr Ford, that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities, should it prove necessary.	1.1700226796375819
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them.	0.8446361812291383
However, if, on verifying the progress made during 1999, which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty, we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out, the scene looks considerably darker, Mr President.	1.011625730014891
As I have said, we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in Europe - without intrusion from interceptions, without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in Europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than administer justice, and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds inconvenient.	1.0305984602767249
Mr President, I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem.	0.6793004044791554
However, I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Council.	1.0105087116092082
Yet, every year we have the same problem.	1.0990987095171056
I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins.	1.060538597824114
For the moment, it appears that, in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - Sweden - there has been a 59% increase in the price of postal services.	1.0367740644284873
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question, particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way, and I shall explain how.	1.0862235597390846
They need a political deal.	0.47209892940225306
Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.	1.0728470108962371
Tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation.	0.543684815025667
We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el­-Sheikh agreements.	0.8575230563553704
It is oil and diamonds which are financing the continuation of the war which, as has been said, is terrible. It has displaced millions of people and caused them to go hungry.	1.0977522799200816
Nor is our role confined to that of banker.	0.6014996584360011
Instead, my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	0.8272264386219708
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it?	0.701725169587091
In some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today.	0.6472959998497287
The following spring to mind in this respect: the systematic collation of documentation and information, professional forms of observation, the development of information campaigns, the use of cash to support democratic forces in the country concerned, a more creative deployment of the resources which are available through multilateral diplomacy, such as organised dialogue and fact finding missions and such like.	0.9143986978924455
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now.	0.7562186962445133
I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too.	0.6688006782659527
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this.	0.6193259554135355
I am not sure exactly what it is, but it is not zero, therefore it must have some effect.	1.033513394309095
I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position.	1.003983854127851
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy.	0.7660526276472156
I share the regrets she expressed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect, which in my view is a pity.	1.0305910858809257
The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience.	0.7556788544557883
My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs.	0.7445067523449028
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory.	1.1001363099870631
I heard Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue, and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed. In other words, he has been given these resources.	0.9869184985336995
Consequently, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens, as borne out in the committee meeting.	1.2475984519026933
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path.	0.6371331602434818
That is, without doubt, too short, too sweet and too little.	1.0207556647687148
In particular, we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded.	0.9228787022167781
I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter.	0.5364488846978129
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light, doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds.	0.7912415333843574
Like Mr Miller, I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or, if at all possible, within the next couple of days.	0.8982846856037268
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.	0.897737338405473
We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged.	0.8067794733093264
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.	0.6410741864547
Democracy, transparency and clarity always lead to results, citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on.	0.9231126619594451
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues.	0.7096458554796986
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned, there may eventually be a ban, but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken.	0.9366862816479959
Firstly, I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments.	1.1048104794580678
The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation.	1.064407578590494
They made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety, for example, are nonsense.	0.9310871340621215
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level.	0.8281752687225263
Böge report (A5-0023/2000)	0.2422593816343037
The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind.	0.88037512765372
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions, including the Commission and Parliament.	1.1698145599397838
Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lomé, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides.	0.9005253444043555
Thank you for the follow-up question.	0.8912050403873835
Mr President, today' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market.	0.8981897062700668
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect.	0.9871967962146386
Secondly, I would like to thank Mr Knörr for his speediness.	0.9948351850443256
Indeed, both parties will need to make huge efforts.	1.0338914596872266
The Lomé Convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for over 25 years.	0.928317599284767
Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers' and employees' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced.	0.7522086325880635
If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence, the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs.	0.8389360184738225
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	0.9778773628847232
This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States.	1.0992761181138002
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart.	0.6759601958592453
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.	1.0036626275527734
What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse.	0.9824574399993876
Mr President, the task of the post office is to ensure that, every day, the post is delivered everywhere, be it in the city or in remote, rural areas, at the same tariff.	1.0126390538543244
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening.	1.188310544639668
A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.	0.9337734310294781
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling.	0.3332414778917632
That is why, today, we must be understanding alchemists, concerned for our environment.	0.984584024863602
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that "the world looks up to Europe" ?	0.9067398635039625
What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient.	1.1323619206082396
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament, mainly with a view to reaching a balance.	0.9507760382986702
The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it.	0.34329720407521164
The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country.	0.6533313864146316
Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent.	0.8904888061732281
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.	1.2416511104016692
We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us.	0.6715065052839554
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?	1.0083828313835408
An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage.	0.7326023872629854
Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies.	0.9062563990412779
It groups them together and that is very important.	0.9117368310926854
I think that all of us, the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, your two representatives, and myself, as a representative of the Commission, will be going into matters in detail, but it will be afterwards, at a different level, one in which we will also be participating, that the last trade-offs must be made.	1.2795944246149082
We also note that, as before, there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments.	0.8026698788398935
However, forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me.	0.8889883567920067
It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is, of course, underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy.	0.6089142221243775
Today, if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers, we should be doing ourselves dishonour.	1.0514028584675696
I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.	1.0747845798811555
The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300(3).	0.8638941331585338
In the past, the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members, government officials or ambassadors; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament.	0.9512564402482141
He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft, violence and rape had been brought against him, one of which was for the rape of a minor.	0.5871470045985622
If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate, measures will need to be taken.	0.8659450880359095
This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board.	0.999129586226056
The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council.	0.9903880033803621
The handover will have been made, but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made, by yourself, Mr President, and by the Portuguese Presidency, are going to be extremely important, as is the nature of this handover.	1.3675014823607916
I will therefore judge you on your deeds.	0.6662400745410582
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making.	0.5995312175625075
In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following:	0.8575840142195995
Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it.	0.8721037084771068
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure.	0.7414921725497097
That foundation is clearly the single market.	0.5497304294121207
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions.	0.7160845033492041
I should like to mention a few specific points.	0.640938633463765
They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages.	0.46887345705708355
The problem considered by the motion is a major one but, as has already been touched upon, could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in Angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster.	0.8542811930066235
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year.	1.0225830652517631
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes.	0.9342043165844338
I should, however, like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions.	0.9028444806439619
Mr President, these are no arbitrary objectives. These are articles, statutory articles, which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply.	1.1509045985074537
(Applause)	-0.0
The human rights policy is also too selective.	0.9143361195605029
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.	1.2991240433501439
We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region's very scarce water resources.	0.8681919925295856
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.	0.9447185541680682
This is the topic.	0.873798159191537
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997.	0.8297097408035137
A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to.	0.47806181122109814
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million.	0.7310778197561211
Mr President, this report is positive but, actually, we need more than this.	1.3943456400196035
On behalf of the combined European right, I must say to you, Mr Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, we do not have confidence in you.	1.0164142598357997
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.	0.7956092416817879
To me, this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle.	0.7745663967215779
Mr President, we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled, even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests can be guaranteed.	1.2553625209426476
Subject: Gender and environment Practically all the contributors involved in the Rio and Kyoto processes - individual organisations, civic action groups, governments, the World Bank, the UN and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision-making on the environment.	0.8872351236490497
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session.	0.4545937013043056
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims.	0.806321574707344
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward.	0.6231234297967724
I am counting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to allocate adequate resources for effective action.	0.9720453096380199
Collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank.	0.5242997445891453
- (FR) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria.	1.1254897172252083
To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies.	0.9432224830686525
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner' s answer.	0.9405224311326544
First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied.	1.1148368854224069
Such policies are necessary, and I would like to see them developed further.	0.9100907047890703
Mr Newton Dunn, I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question, and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future.	0.8752722715758229
The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms, namely, the issue of interethnic relations.	0.9411413506353825
There is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society.	0.480594136913704
In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code.	1.0294825627363116
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways.	0.9952665822948726
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.	0.7555330301902893
Could you please give an answer on this issue?	0.7150348302001904
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.	0.49393068773697374
In the course of the 1980s, most markets in Europe underwent drastic deregulation. As a result, the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years.	0.951625508447868
In the end tax would politicise the global, undemocratic system of financial power.	0.5966288678860069
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.	0.6715847919893726
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either.	0.7831879551692311
In this regard, Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language.	0.8244454957253524
There must be an overriding economic interest.	0.5815472562915549
We, however, second the Council' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus.	0.7449775964446975
Having said that, I thought your question related more to the partnership issue.	0.8257195838556951
A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines".	0.8520143673843136
The vast majority of these citizens are elderly people and pensioners, who want a peaceful retirement and who, after the problems encountered during the course of their working lives, have at last found financial peace of mind.	0.7747400838427034
However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly.	1.0968631842309349
I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it.	1.043053699142762
Mr Alavanos, if an action of this kind should be brought against NATO and if this action were to be brought against Mr Javier Solana personally, we would have to bear in mind that Mr Javier Solana held one post at that time and is holding a different one today.	0.9714169471929807
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars, and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open.	0.8555561961608974
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158).	0.9855685166908126
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	0.7337908694779014
The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars.	0.5629746811167484
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000.	0.6061609592933899
It represents a step towards the area of freedom, security and, particularly, justice to which we all aspire.	1.07346647911545
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality, that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law.	0.9922689477326138
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter.	0.6770238904512673
There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted.	0.6294335273043236
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?	1.070280834761805
My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week' s debate.	0.9623202468728103
The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.	0.9955230259180856
(Applause)	-0.0
Therefore, once our legislation has been brought into line, we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law. We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays' principle of responsibility which is, of course, supposed to be a deterrent.	1.0418718696615945
This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro.	0.9236634767359039
Madam President, Mr Prodi, how would you take stock of your policy and work programme, what would your benchmark be, if you had to make direct choices?	1.0077723764296176
It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue.	0.8347396512289692
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children.	1.025129746285694
I do not believe that it is anybody' s intention to do so.	0.8316802696272039
As an ecologist, let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches.	0.7746960042296364
And so, Mr Seppänen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.	1.225941650933241
The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council.	0.8493813005041038
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.	0.6262513798189763
And therein lies the paradox.	0.3424916184283954
In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.	0.8826102919382102
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed.	0.8858299179742151
I would also like to point out, Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature. It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.	1.036098033859537
Report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 - 'Comitology' (1999/468/EC)	0.8460489216529843
Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.	0.8933340708854722
We must, of course, always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help.	0.8062782948634462
The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres.	0.8900682851414161
Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which, quite obviously, is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre.	1.0117040504214923
We know there are 13 applicant countries, from Lithuania to Turkey, and just one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants, we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle.	1.1390971780002637
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this.	0.7919520267229672
I wonder how this will develop.	0.3428423834348367
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future.	0.7846932087892837
I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us.	0.7829008172278187
Madam President, until now we believed that the European Union was, according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities, and subsequently the Union, an association of free, independent, sovereign states.	0.9844975849675671
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable, except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions, or rather billions, into Switzerland.	0.9241567708310268
But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.	0.8577767640643981
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.	1.0320895789783926
In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost, as soon as possible, to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary.	1.2297412981614972
Cyprus and Malta	-0.0
Until we have a firm position, we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities.	1.200687103507825
I think that we have just had a great political debate, equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it.	1.1111994624480754
The other amendments are unacceptable.	0.6134968187868306
In any case, the Babitsky affair warrants one conclusion: the leaders in Moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically Chechen crime.	0.5406985331649924
Mr MacCormick, the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated, for the 2000-2006 period, in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds.	1.128798909729734
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to make one point. Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency.	0.896380828929122
Of course this is also the basic idea.	1.0605238907032215
What concrete measures have been discussed?	0.5097942473255219
VOTE (continuation)	0.31566021430285685
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.	0.9416574817976667
I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world, and particularly in China.	0.8411965408569694
In particular, the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site.	0.8639229453983208
The first concerns the product, that is to say the funds.	0.8929148415140458
Everything else is wishful thinking.	0.26097018632405306
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occurring again.	1.0488457968154943
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.	0.7171844121643801
We are asking workers to be flexible, innovative and ever more productive, yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone.	0.7776442780696471
the oral question (B5-0005/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Commission, on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax.	0.9439147724643301
The first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs, the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment, the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion.	0.845061217468117
He has convinced me of that.	0.3860959486807066
Alas, there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no-one feels responsible being derailed and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF.	0.8686115128144556
Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the "green line" in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long.	0.7589740589101925
And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs.	0.6269637501301704
. I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the committee chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission's proposal.	1.131821916493633
That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund.	0.7765290514065006
Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture.	0.9245134419424665
In the two documents, strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and, to this end, to introduce a new agenda for the Commission, establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment, through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the States, and, primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation.	0.9288281460261784
In any event, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO.	0.9531249421338678
Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it?	1.011671580376429
This argument is therefore not relevant.	0.6116945555101062
Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act.	1.1046537962224732
The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions.	0.5090572028556551
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue.	1.3063660877691827
In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected.	0.8916400328390865
However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market.	1.0903669605832866
I agree, absolutely. We shall do so.	1.0778237676548723
However, in this case, the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens.	1.307861814041997
In short, we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol, while at the same time promoting growth in our economies.	0.7993115442341338
The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus.	0.9977718031342094
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain.	0.7073535380764024
With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them.	0.6964054673575876
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.	0.48745269323536056
But Ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious.	0.6560722236881503
This question needs to be resolved urgently.	0.6850820311833885
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace.	0.9697835115711815
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.	0.9318136602686046
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months.	0.7736283296922117
I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years.	0.7473595034306196
We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us.	1.0210217694956298
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat?	0.8737236491832149
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.	0.981434331578326
Mr Commissioner, the problem is that when Mr Aznar comes to the European Union to receive money for all the people of Andalusia, he counts all of them, but when he goes to the Andalusia Council to pay for services, he fails to notice 400 000 Andalusians, and this is very serious, because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of Strasbourg or a city larger than Granada, full of children.	1.0590224109394013
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.	0.9592621142944914
We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace.	0.9462274676178242
Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this.	1.0008828084714765
Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.	0.9799188635628147
Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right.	0.9752521104894961
Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office.	0.890953196783764
To grasp the importance of tourism for some parts of Europe, it is worth pointing out that in my own country, Greece, a country that attracts tourists, over the past four decades, during which the farming population has clearly aged and the population is over-concentrated in the major urban centres, the only areas which have retained populations of low average age or to which young people have returned are ones where tourism has developed.	0.9279111911272329
I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter.	0.9734821180946325
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen.	0.7087213731303554
Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power.	0.9838251265469893
But then again, the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment.	0.9096364770716864
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe.	0.5851202634579896
. (FR) Mr Decourrière' s report is not without merit: at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and its role in opening up border regions, it comes out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16.	1.1370957934918633
This, however, does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously.	1.108738172760264
In my opinion, it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment, which are such nice toys, after all.	0.918235596839221
What we really need to focus on, however, is making the checks more effective.	0.8436519158857195
(FR) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency.	0.8266341467652589
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	1.0482635317128002
Nevertheless, I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points.	0.9466101449921445
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that, unfortunately, democracy is not fully functioning yet.	0.804660741927569
This must be brought forward.	0.9538583131677649
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.	0.9200881256707937
In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs.	0.7618134401393354
In so doing, we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric.	1.097482830682062
. (DA) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market, which ought to be promoted and encouraged.	0.885259298557168

Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day.	0.8734080550191933
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point.	1.0782662071442906
I hope that Europe, in terms of social protection, will make a step forward, taking into account subsidiarity, for without subsidiarity, this would not be possible.	1.251092459439545
I think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer has warned us so vehemently, to wit, that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend.	1.054513515470894
In some cases, it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased, but there are budgetary restraints of which I am sure you are aware.	1.0325430176299777
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?	1.0356422572646424
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.	0.8257087624386824
In 1999, the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over-stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions, pushing up the prices of long-term financial and real assets.	0.7569655807045831
I have already appeared before the French Senate.	0.7940446161735475
I therefore took a European Commissioner, and not just the French ones, or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week. This made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected, listened to and informed.	0.9375155812773799
The call for women' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full.	0.9168131385565073
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we congratulate them on this as well.	1.0645006621823374

The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.	0.874565507359927

The moment of truth is approaching.	0.3887687342390322
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.	0.9508250503444462
I also stressed the need for prevention.	0.5661529503323454
The goal is, after all, to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates, in the first place, but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights.	0.9553488557961565
Yet it is not enough to regret the situation.	0.919445616779046

Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct.	0.7421596512142049
I think we should take a more positive approach here.	0.8941632580194968
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other.	1.117255840208967
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion.	0.9554411563066529
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers remarked yesterday, can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.	1.296129315152027
I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations.	1.2111482463079464
Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de siècle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat.	0.8614557895293006
That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges.	0.7023096050263837
This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made.	1.2653790407839873
This highlights the problems of coherence between the EU and the developing nations, which came to a head at the WTO talks in Seattle.	1.0173182965248166
State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.	0.9906839771692864
In a way, this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty, at the time, in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters.	0.9393871573634148
We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources.	0.8657646449120482
I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce.	1.120772833010149
We should continue to exert strong pressure on the Government of Cyprus, but one section of the population cannot blackmail the wish of the majority. Besides, we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is.	0.9689298652749984
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÜV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years.	0.8741982176625871
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time.	0.7255085458497922
Ultimately, we also need to achieve better cooperation, of course, between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts.	1.100953930549085
However, if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy, we will end up totally frustrated and, furthermore, the result will be negative.	1.0160284625340155
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising. What are the respective places of people and finance in today' s economy?	0.7223879279656525

Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.	1.059147939035395

First of all, the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers.	0.9019665925888684
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects.	0.9347287063412018
According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.	0.9412620280641578
Is this too much of a burden?	0.6080319921265243
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done.	1.0186527956360878
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency.	0.3085512305079072
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly.	0.9164461054139164
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing.	0.875684524821705
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency, particularly Mr Seixas da Costa, for his proactive approach.	0.9972865965055829
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament.	0.6483447968624039
This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution.	1.2322693133387297
However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that.	1.0016409861507565
I passionately defend Europe' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law.	0.7356582723845262

The Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, is but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe, which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms.	0.952010848787579
Reconciliation with your neighbours was, and still is, a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance.	0.9228799171516053
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate?	0.759407929967931
The government too is responsible for this continuing violence. This is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds.	0.8115223206568575
In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative.	1.124572900425676
Madam President, Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets.	0.9563022073925395
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take good note of this need for coordination, which I have just mentioned, and to seek new formulas which will strengthen the role played by the European Union in the field of human rights and, in particular, by this Parliament, especially from the point of view of coherence, recognising the good will of those third countries which accept the inclusion of the democratic clause.	1.1062258631979625
These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here.	0.5530046050706062
Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!	1.1257836055673742
I was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote, since I believe that, in essence, the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly, despite the fact that, as we all know, the governments of the 15 Member States would like to reduce pensions to the minimum.	1.1291410357919887
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	0.21280715129501784
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.	0.9046398364909699
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries.	0.5113060248104976
To support this statement, I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague, Mário Soares, in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans.	1.016507244552529
A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls, causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises.	0.5360332958544314
Over the coming months, that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us.	1.0318775736280816
Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved.	0.5503566059954753
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.	1.0650063649584707
You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government.	0.6820845075951051
You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion.	1.065471663960265
If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group, I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission, its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers.	1.112661893002019
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union.	1.0163650567510851
May I, to finish off, thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having, in that way, added an important degree of meaning to her report?	0.8911148201914404
The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states.	1.012736323661113
(Applause)	-0.0
So our response must be rapid and strong.	0.5211395660065572
We would, on the other hand, like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber.	1.06061149110937
For example, I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal.	0.885813483351054
The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission.	0.744322820969382
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget.	0.8410016172877199
This is the foundation, ladies and gentlemen, which I intend to develop, and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration: firstly, providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme.	0.861731104188791
The debate is closed.	0.24018021559897584
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.	1.1436670164952802
Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called "soft law" .	0.7097316245545519
Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict, of so-called "water wars", in the coming decades, what is the Commission's view about the potential destabilisation, both in Turkey and in the wider region, that will be caused by this dam?	1.0032233788474159
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.	0.9700830533966048
That is, after all, a question the people often ask.	0.908486639406006
We are badly behind now in this matter.	0.347929028623034
This directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties.	0.8464809724206108
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects.	0.8694303574124348
Our response must be rapid.	0.35375385927553116
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact, as others have said this afternoon, constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years.	0.9460415502072087
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your dedication.	0.7420006980099506
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.	0.8766763227700369
I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there.	1.2051567874611897
. (PT) In response to your question, Mrs McKenna, I would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the Court of Auditors was laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.	1.0152287248846865
Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives.	0.9844983042275062
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.	1.1039812799812803
There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur.	0.8913967827808366
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table.	0.6829247730921795
Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion.	0.9861787842392707
Mr President, I welcome much, indeed most, of what has been said in this debate.	1.4403312090742528
May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte?	0.5951996062138896
When our rivers flooded in 1990, we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage.	0.6455919093629893
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer.	1.1607529699738202
I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.	1.154101776822825
Secondly, this is not fair towards employees of other companies where reorganisations also take place and where it hurts too.	0.8457414869957635
I suppose that the first thing they say will be, 'let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the Union' .	0.9271992854207023
The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell.	0.606868568909236
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.	0.9149813441593677
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.	0.8097423856362516
However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9186866861703226
Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council.	0.7697511080422653
We shall vote against these objectives, because we are fighting against this policy both in Parliament and on the streets.	0.9492926776557735
Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled.	0.9189200797901274
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas, environmental, human, animal and plant health; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht.	1.0572469362328003
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible.	0.8901674763430507
Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community.	1.203543186258847
However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.	0.8725063438694943
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, which would mean widening the agenda.	0.9652793556448604
The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing.	0.40717812246361235
This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences, i.e. increasing unemployment, exclusion and delinquency.	0.790894491392188
With regard to the second contribution, what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors.	0.8662291527065219
I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results.	1.2043994149293165
Everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that, with the necessary trust, perseverance and indispensable political will, our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East, will be achieved.	1.110655449700075
This list of actions, which is not exhaustive, should, here today, in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House, help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area, it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase, marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.	1.1651969352914182
We only ask one thing of the Commission: that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories.	0.9238233075551665
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one.	1.2089846907318136
Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?	0.82173120627835
This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is.	1.1135184500035178
(Parliament rejected the request) President.	0.5768359376632364
We must also critically examine the classification societies.	0.7100757878225208
This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace.	0.7138114012635012
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment, and what these commitments are? Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing, recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment, or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?	0.845656410565604
On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and, in this respect, I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament' s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo.	1.0393273122411986
However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well.	0.7880022518567922
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council.	0.8418303134150229
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector.	0.8491085476637428
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.0031447511561677
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of, in my view, useful figures.	0.7163901956414239
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully.	0.5579610489307374
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response to the Member' s first question and the supplementary question.	1.029882036198817
The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened.	0.9509526190859038
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.	1.0136318467867507
It is therefore meaningless, and often impossible, directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments.	0.8512136165190215
Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected.	0.9573215207962984
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)	0.25685447417065177
As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.	1.2184110439683862
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience.	0.5255528879545086
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too.	0.8305940076802242
Quite simply, I want us to be engaged with China.	1.1782522631006216
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but, worst of all, their effect will be counter-productive.	0.8664995540681532
In the case of Turkey it is different.	0.6124841238471666
In other words, for many citizens, and not just in your country, you personify the European values to which we constantly voice our attachment.	1.0133582126025353
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction.	0.4173263992743791
I believe that the European Union must do likewise.	1.0943940725981698
Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars.	0.7026496024060556
The European Union has already laid the basis for Community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race.	1.018300064878185
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.7029551111543973
I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe.	0.9175059875370035
It is important to remember that.	0.677435394647243
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an advertisement for coherent work on the part of the Commission.	0.8979161309431702
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow.	0.9414987116373192
As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said.	1.249323110647569
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.	0.5486919049152826
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say.	0.938268241709685
It is a fact that the road has been a long one, mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the Community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property.	0.9609646306244553
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource.	0.40997525075934294
Subject: High infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die, while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm.	0.5846759691998921
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement.	0.7664559535339269
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.	0.6563954761033994
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to.	0.7470910468401115
Direct business to consumer contact will supplement, and sometimes also reduce, the currently, nearly exclusive business to business relationship.	0.7157168649721846
Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision.	1.0451148158570962
Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States.	0.8468779001596789
The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here.	0.8244031300975964
It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000.	0.7109212454818614
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, it becomes clear that the European Union' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful.	0.920254223842131
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, which were represented by competent and exacting delegations.	1.0087917091368885
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen.	0.8112124880946235
The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the 'polluter pays' principle.	0.6565684800638825
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean?	0.928454897576969
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable.	0.8813107243855859
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.	0.5075767131505751
As regards the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned, we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the framework on tourism.	0.8946914543298763
. The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters.	0.959450993827891
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said.	0.9122315123081721
Finally, as has already been said, it is essential, and I hope that the IGC will cover this, to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas, with democratic and judicial scrutiny.	1.231904184547514
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area.	0.9606217034160094
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions.	0.710192637438626
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.	0.8399330057035292
They need a 'European soul' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said.	0.917155354922957
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo.	0.38522491237603834
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier' of the Union.	0.932958702564123
We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission' s programme.	0.9399056132007162
Surely Assad would be Barak' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister.	0.6460959183124911
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself.	0.7639105586551697
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue.	1.1623979393947508
Nowadays, it is becoming more commonplace, as well as efficient, to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes.	0.8922694221899066
The INTERREG III programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission, pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, continues these measures.	0.8327814646609751
Result: a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself.	0.8600435897564658
Thank you for your attention.	0.7481600105170757
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework.	0.48865833890583643
As for subsequent phases, in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level. It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national, regional and local level.	1.119805150904936
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society.	0.7779116182319427
They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country.	0.6913540531357253
When the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 January 2002, everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro.	0.8210934925533897
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report.	1.077828679235204
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive, but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to, at a later date, put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions, for strand C.	1.0367955248603669
OLAF, Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and, when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States, we can also achieve a lot with this.	0.9282987102134389
This suggests that something must be done, failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen.	0.5546453658178163
These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise.	0.6737708164714061
This is not in question.	1.1607539123037787

Six, to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis.	0.8647894683835128
It is clear that is not acceptable.	1.0228065884458701
In welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative, it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular: physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility, visual information systems which exclude blind workers, working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems.	0.6116268691583343
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.	0.9261068268985381
In a word, I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe, fellow Members, when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves.	0.9502728243813416
For a long time, probably a survival of our colonial heritage, our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland, ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours.	0.8060763496308319
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities.	0.6310138641851339
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010?	0.9947925024852491
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement.	0.6281329306602308
This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU.	0.9831816573270189
I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.	1.0770337485051213
It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order.	0.8512596900583596
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles, as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market.	0.7895034891554877

The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion.	0.8425677520567266

The only way of stopping the diabolical machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit, on pain of compulsory purchase, and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public.	0.9917296409622428

For example, we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission.	1.0322285307976573
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation.	0.9078383914809662
The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma: whom should they support, the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food?	0.7601233871358671
However, efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province.	0.7508847768655849
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years.	0.6921514995151651
All the European States are known throughout the world for being tourist magnets envied by all, including the United States of America, which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native Americans.	1.0984967891783093
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs. Criticism of the previous Commission' s work was particularly severe, legitimately so, with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices.	0.9081206615371462
We must, therefore, ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today, with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles, values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union, with regard, among other things, to running the economy.	1.060210534439269
Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.	1.0504610090040687
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.	0.613035175324024
Madam President, as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and also as an MEP for the Basque Nationalist Party, I must firstly categorically condemn the cowardly attack which took the lives of a Basque police officer, Jorge Díez Elorza, and the Basque MP and former vice-president, Fernando Buesa.	0.9226772712628847
We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on having the wisdom, in order to make things perfectly clear, to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage.	0.8962595964358355
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.	0.9748241114086387
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report.	0.8352560690562754
Of course, we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes, but everyone hoped that the Culture programme could help to promote, for example, the unique features of each cultural sector, even - and I could say especially - of the unique features of less well-known sectors.	1.130086754293573
Personally, I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.	0.8547187835748109
Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this.	1.0707454894930877
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies, but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes.	1.0712485777001637
However, these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted, in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the Community initiatives, particularly INTERREG.	0.8895296247539914
I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market.	0.5567818344619695
Of course they do, but they are not unlimited.	1.1587794590393625
As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%).	0.9741422696223304
We therefore ask the European Commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development.	0.9814956168150228
Relating to Amendment No 31	0.35377353252954785
II. the draft Council decision amending Decision 88/591/ECSC, EEC, Euratom establishing a Court of First Instance of the European Communities (9614/1999 - C5-0167/1999 - 1999/0805(CNS))	0.7127964358130751
This is not our opinion.	0.995656359229103
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.	0.9751705318934926
My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this.	0.9756296103161244
The European Parliament needs to acquire the resources, which it currently lacks, to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures, and the Commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective.	1.0741607681058642
In this respect, and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union, we should be helping it to become a more secure, peaceful and cooperative country.	1.0929157705759365
That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today.	1.0231864736385352
It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations.	0.8063016965751608
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate.	0.7439938306335385
Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position.	0.8377750278672325
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities.	1.0038338299874914
The general lines of the implemented economic policy, the Stability Pact and the strict convergence programmes, which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations, and the organisation of labour, along with Commission and the ESF decisions relating to salary and wage restraint, and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much-vaunted monetary stability at all costs, leave no doubt about the new strategy' s objectives and aspirations.	0.9148472618891401
We do drink port wine, and we do like German beer, and we even use Finnish saunas, but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat.	1.1228570187288165
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority.	0.8892082173286129
However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint.	1.013929549781849
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice.	0.5195024438972866
The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union.	0.7007415973182471
For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020.	0.9787358057561538
Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.	0.9144906570407483
I would ask him to be brief.	1.0044460363104433
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs McCarthy, as rapporteurs for the general regulation, had asked.	1.1307794516710414
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much.	0.7806637923592535
However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue.	1.0262562261194963
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected.	0.8097615010041541
Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind.	1.108742541708058
This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction.	0.9265273901838377
It has been a huge task, and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann' s amendments. These are all improvements to the common position.	1.1291749835705378
The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations?	1.1042770533369577
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights.	0.7040107924595421
Some areas are becoming drier, whilst many are becoming wetter.	0.7005420848524528
A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective, and this is not the case for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, dubious uncoordinated operations, assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy.	0.8650223221773108
These aspects are very much interconnected.	0.6452212989092696
Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards.	0.839133322253901
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.	0.9643409483080672
The danger is too great for us to ignore.	0.5546645564983373
A return to the roots, at last, for a Community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history marred by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance.	0.7394205648099827
The definitions 'standardised futures contracts' and 'standardised options' should therefore be combined to form a new definition, 'financial derivative instruments' , which also covers OTC derivatives.	0.7293871655110282
And the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify.	0.7055855182325151
Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report.	0.7394730607646927
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.	0.7510293006627738
This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question.	0.8318765501006424
If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens.	0.9030645195162526
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view.	0.35495827144668457
Let us learn the lessons of the past.	0.7110681880928263
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about, the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion.	0.6300353768923035
Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat.	0.9723697566291666
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.	0.8178529411205072
So what was done at Amsterdam?	0.488884329151467
The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism.	0.97460323708625
The vote will take place on Thursday.	0.41726121931410426
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense.	0.9277445629755001
Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity.	1.0018266900855042
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle.	0.689023644593165
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.	0.6904700940901376
(Applause)	-0.0
This is not the Union' s only contribution.	0.8882624750354395
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union.	0.8011646588745288
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments.	1.0822191386797377
Four, to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee, at least one Member per political group.	1.135730904957469
That is to say, if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem, where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on, ad infinitum.	0.9193198228054623
As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said in her speech, 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, an expectation realised with the conclusions of the Tampere Council, and a fundamental expectation, as from this year, that will be realised in the form of specific actions.	0.8961047758308578
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.	0.6245223409874793
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women' s full participation in power structures and decision making.	0.8224043825196331
Madam President, we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000, set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning.	1.196133091937666
The debate is closed.	0.207322097979593
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.	0.7404323248624762
By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough.	1.0022882251047094
Yesterday, we also discussed the Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, who gave its opinion.	1.0203730814904384
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.	1.1249927627927483
We must create joint, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social operators, play an active role.	0.9532937201511519
In my view, we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally.	0.8843627743195531
I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always, as he indicated, worthwhile.	0.7935096405298917
That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see.	0.9420231552011872
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4.	0.9631542781994958
There is no room for amendments.	0.6063769508362353
Mr President, for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.	0.92531748437373
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application.	0.9333914169538999
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.	0.9522100717368258
This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors.	0.8794841331099289
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts.	0.9487831443779456
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board.	1.103256904102885
We have been asked for EUR 35 million.	0.8678228703310621
. (SV) I cannot support the present resolution because, in paragraph 8, an individual factory in Italy is singled out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place, while the current management is being advised to try to sell the factory to a European tyre manufacturer.	0.9096087489352156
Another important area is protection of the groundwater.	0.7409419948053019
The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake.	1.1347537873122033
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President, Mr Kinnock, on behalf of the Commission.	1.1067807219899122
After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson, I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals, not only by Mr Nielson, but by the entire Commission, in order to make the policy coherent as a whole.	1.1017414265084853
I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee.	0.9206600975092726
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and, especially, aid to shipyards.	0.8922832542445096
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency.	0.7231949814159759
Clearly, any future social action programme should take account of developments, for example within information technology, and, in time, become a modern social action programme.	1.0334259364235354
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.	1.0027873715097182
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport.	0.5601473759652941
I think that the Commission could have been more pro-active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested.	1.0563282099208133
In point 14, Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately.	0.8834801867231323
Young, creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside. If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more.	0.7815030635246419
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.	0.4002562008653138
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained.	0.8393256683521119
In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy.	1.0790430778592217
In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected.	0.4574907257306205
This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service.	0.794346597537642
In all such cases, however, strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained.	0.6915646798488632
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue.	1.1158973014806086
At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court.	0.9406081669089916
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares.	0.5438062675728574
This would then give us, for Wednesday' s sitting, the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and on the UN 'Human Rights' sitting, followed by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the reports by Mr Swoboda, Mr Corrie, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Knörr Borràs.	1.0665459596035258
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance.	1.2302218390242343
It is time for action.	0.7814139685804417
It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union.	1.071930269426945
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank.	0.8088918146313014
Today, a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking, and the current systems are, in the main, run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States.	1.0461231301326874
Apart from Amendment No 76, which was an error, since I intended to vote in favour, the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation:	1.0756537719130899
When it comes to pollution, like sin, we are all against it, but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good.	0.866991990591779
We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe, confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation, encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet, show that e-Europe is a good initiative.	0.7742885758711966
The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	0.8177021978899174
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget.	0.9775889716092508
This report is very good and our Group supports it.	0.8067503903138087
The Commission welcomes, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, which apply to the Committee procedures.	0.8495801015471912
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists.	0.9165519364075072
It would weaken a key element of European policy.	0.5484646922515938
It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of.	1.026812788032625
Having received a delegation from the Austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of Almería, it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred.	0.8117963197441748
We deplore the fact that the Commission, in its opinion of 26 January, limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East, a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions.	0.7642986717444
The debate is closed.	0.07678482260461908
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation.	0.5399127201918829
I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it.	1.1457332084067438
The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products.	0.6462328314506942
It is still the old imperial service.	0.7554548901042941
In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens.	0.9043987400837106
Finally, I must congratulate the Council Presidency on the coming Europe-Africa Summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace, democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of Africa.	1.036007399413089
And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne, a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you. What about the BSE test?	0.8297399168150142
As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative' s remarks today were extremely encouraging.	1.0767194752426015
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here.	0.49302443535395907
If it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or researching these, they can be found with the rapporteurs, among them the author of the report on this convention.	1.049801889742624
The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars: that of the rule of law.	0.8358608232555689
We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about, that is, how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it.	0.7840632497041572
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods.	0.4197069263906645
During the procedure, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise, implement, complement and assess the Community measures.	0.5901293749177408
This is my main concern in this matter.	0.7622298471922555
You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it, in the entire area, is Greece, and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area.	1.1071008801790871
It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years' worth of experience.	1.1024978233246048
The opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted, and, furthermore, the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans.	0.9249401518971678
Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.	0.9371103580693223
Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects.	0.757834080386804
So we are working within this framework and not outside it.	0.8269510060409353
What can the European Union do, without interfering in internal affairs in Cyprus, to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the European Community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the Union within the next few years?	1.195796958662955
It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission.	1.0542220223004808
Colleagues, you know the rules.	0.9396840660645988
Instead, we should be reforming and decentralising control.	1.0532421041274118
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia has sunk.	0.741317259565326
When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned.	0.9560052705151701
I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there.	0.8519406620578968
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.	1.085540129058411
Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime.	0.8380239385608503
Who would want this to happen?	0.49407881937918624
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?	0.8239818731056852
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years.	0.7828434353799801
I think we should give this some thought.	0.7999286816953969
It also inspires a few political comments.	0.5518496401336361
This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries' capacity to conduct trade negotiations.	0.79445921162394
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible.	1.0156764406271117
I do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years.	0.5997016277510335
We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter.	1.0584324583794302
As far as the Treaty is concerned, the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet.	0.8611503459361908
Commissioner, Mr Solana, there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas.	1.0907869144783233
Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe.	0.8484955592255609
I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this.	0.9381755215234808
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997.	0.7705990515148072
Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed.	1.0391741004825659
Finally, I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society, although, unfortunately, this is another contradiction.	0.9917431395387708
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food.	0.8085167367535961
Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999, NATO's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's minority communities.	0.82790012009902
The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one.	1.016304616058887
In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based. The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties.	1.0288846746871887
We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström' s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness.	0.8731360819759915
We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you, which have always guided your actions; your attachment to fundamental values.	0.9151245809641726
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	0.823104726265352
It is the Tisza, Hungary' s second river, perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people, that has borne the brunt.	0.7337184331692926
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.	0.9138538901404051
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea.	0.8262996204709108
Although I understand that, according to some, this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially, I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure.	1.151514311830892
Guidelines of the Directive: a) each city shall provide the means, in terms of energy and technology, sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012; b) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices.	0.7531134079289179
As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China.	1.1279622601131076
The debate is closed.	0.07875360802159034
Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem.	1.0013532498620188
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds.	0.5325411535682494
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.	1.0594805573810253
I would still like to highlight this point though: this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State' s territory against its will.	0.9068840420557781
We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission' s disposal, but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them.	1.2276165799976808
It is not an old one, it was issued in 1997.	1.1940155876883918
Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential.	0.8290777802536449
It simplifies things and brings things up to date.	0.4424119629023012
..., with all the rights and commitments that this entails!	0.9112270387723399
I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again.	0.5954247637863138
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate.	0.8381051819661817
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry.	0.843862370158807
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today.	1.0886056320997162
Therefore, Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect, because this type of menace, which we have suffered before in Europe, may not only harm Austria, but it may also spread, and I say this bearing history in mind.	1.1598490591591102
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate.	0.9576243182953657
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.	0.6719562162480973
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.	1.127110480479023
You say there will be no further funding.	0.7530203895667014
Indeed, the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability.	0.7642578020922083
I welcome Parliament's support for that.	0.4212931109433258
We are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows.	0.8502110719443265
We are concerned with public official actions and events, rather than any possible underlying motivation.	0.7138177889024485
Instead, we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations.	0.8625761584261834
The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted.	0.833279073769605
But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources, when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries, only then, in my view, should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage.	0.9486048640846491
Undoubtedly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer.	1.1026883715371354
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.	0.5460949250975285
As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June.	0.9775552463418318
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.	0.6810544406194332
We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states' interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction.	1.0267856408454552
Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security, and for flexibilising social protection itself.	0.9300723248605753
Mr President, in a world such as this, which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation, and not only in the economic field, our responses, in order to be effective, must be concerted and coordinated.	1.1190135214628365
History has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold: using heated words first, in populist, xenophobic speeches, and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually, poisoning them, until the day they start to take action.	0.7998209536918814
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled.	0.4260624156674267
But, more importantly than that, cultural activities are what make mankind civilised.	0.950902477255209
It is of key importance that the American authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a dignified alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life.	0.6917475864830293
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety, but I would ask you to endorse this report.	0.9749272919717437
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain.	0.6027705262586347
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement.	1.0330436674657077
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance.	0.46351049656581966
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war.	0.7112912701990926
This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years.	0.9419221782146676
Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary, all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions.	0.7591769226473404
This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added.	0.7735497990657847
That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole.	0.8858838083740593
You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit.	0.9350047198054768
For instance, the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered.	0.9049779842285743
A flourishing tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick.	0.5150169123497619
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics.	0.5723809961286649
The rapporteur' s phrasing was therefore too limiting.	0.3091642215252025
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks.	0.9932396133359931
Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.	0.8053832507275068
I would, however, remind you, and this is my final point, that the Commission is not the only Community institution.	1.3401964514707392
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics.	0.9502111624442189
In the same way, this damage and these tragedies which are happening, as in Romania, are not the problem of the legislative, but of the executive and of the governments.	1.187986821088101
What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997?	0.6950309549399888
In offering this explanation of my vote, therefore, I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern.	0.6258969380628111
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region.	1.0361779130001014
I am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties, in favour of sustainable urban development, involving at the same time this integrated approach, which we value, to handle the economic, social and environmental aspects simultaneously.	1.1051285399881867
We will talk about this on another day.	0.6055398100415631
We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.	1.231590941318871
As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities.	1.1293908981649627
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.	0.7429261305643069
Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns, which a number of you termed arbitrary.	0.8655088621842861
In our opinion, the Commission' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal.	0.9730650243794279
Recourse to the precautionary principle	0.2511493760731927
Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery.	0.9932081406256402
Have you already included your second term of office?	0.4398412761861439
We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled, whose aim is to improve it.	1.2098006555993412
Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace.	0.7980295849710598
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.	0.7935509958730101
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am a right-wing Member of Parliament but I have the same battles as my colleagues in supporting and assisting fellow citizens in my country to gain power and access to decision-making posts, which should be feasible not only in the political arena but clearly also in all sectors of society.	0.9629142356055936
Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.	1.0040340487664556
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example.	0.46127222375552634
At the same time, we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid.	0.7176633280653107
I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result.	0.9120893554503614
I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity.	0.8767688771719472
I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then, the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state' s tax revenue.	0.8357593244408126
All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union.	0.7013857479004059
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.	0.8251394746893317
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.	0.9280307258511881
On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region.	1.049951163007235
An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers.	0.8346834824929145
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.	0.7322916236891996
Ultimately, it is a question of different spheres of authority, where the European Parliament and its Members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands.	0.9116301778379512
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important.	1.2965796226261455
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome.	0.9222869773619303
The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998.	0.7642472036890138
Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors.	0.4863953099212182
The Council ought to have given Parliament the stipulated three-month period within which to consider, too, the last document produced on this matter, but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place.	1.0287492094298956
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role.	0.8125974610378095
We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with.	0.9805370388026906
Is there any prospect of membership?	0.47992280326456516
That is why he deserves special mention!	0.7558964070311175
I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones.	0.7581671593041478
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.	0.48466312274483103
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.258164750928929
This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, however, which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must, as far as we are concerned, necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity, which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject.	1.0773553270261578
Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.	1.1036213847814513
All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them.	1.0447432003301653
Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner.	0.7961396075006291
There is more to be said on that score.	0.95141393267006
The Presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in Europe, which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the Portuguese Presidency, in conjunction with the Commission, in February 2000.	1.0424671190007786
The Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 8, 18, 27, 29, 42, 43, 47, 54, 60, 62, 93, 94, 104 and 105.	0.6115702735992341
To summarise, perhaps what struck me most in your speech; above all, you wished to remind us that, beyond its economic aspects, the task of constructing Europe is a spiritual one.	0.9383263797886489

Mr President, having listened to the Council and the Commission today, I just had to look at my agenda.	1.2301630197433766
I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action.	1.1518252624308851

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report, which, on reading it, gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council' s draft decision.	0.958959676536461
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.	0.9000769716407206
If Amendment No 45 does not fall, I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services.	0.8514986944540093
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.	0.6402581352234816
Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail.	0.6608531328175823
All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned.	0.7395945008555058
Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process, disregarding the fact that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all?	0.9813506807643217
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.	0.9103379558730748
Despite these objections of mine to the Council' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote.	0.9283969920575069

The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services.	0.8926516233873772
This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens.	1.163168132218386
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.7494862935800862
The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes, in our view, the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today.	0.9984418401775628
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent.	0.9764245716231201
We know that some Member States are still wavering, for example, between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, as in the Aspe valley.	0.8393219817207246

It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena. That would not be fulfilling our mission.	0.9579885458767174

I would just like to underline this - the situation is, of course, a little precarious - Parliament has, for the sake of convenience and safety, placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being, so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed.	1.079435379362021

In conclusion, while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process, now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process, Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward.	0.996279912771683

Upon referral to committee, we examined over a hundred amendments and, so far, 17 amendments, some of which have already been presented in committee, have once again been tabled.	1.0429209354926985
It is the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern, so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-à-vis Albania is really not acceptable.	0.7602494418314564
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal.	0.8975530168847041
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future.	1.0598371466512542

It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.	0.6846682171169365
Firstly, these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and, to my mind, the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty, which have not been fully realised. This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support.	1.088350227431554
I should just like to recall that, during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission, every Commissioner was questioned by the Women' s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field.	0.6705664051549045
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.	1.3200585397911606

The ACP-EU agreements make a mockery of democratic principles and the fight against corruption, by sparing those who are responsible: when will sanctions and controls be imposed on Total-Elf, which is supplying those responsible for the civil war in the Congo?	0.821700239720472
Which is why, unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees, all these plans on paper will lead to new blood-letting in the Balkans.	0.8626181629613383
On the other hand, prevention is essential.	0.34762443226154177
It is particularly appropriate that Mr Monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all, even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the European Union.	0.7950745663338374

I wish you every success, President of the Council, in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion, also when the French Presidency takes over, by the end of this year.	1.1270388716419748

Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole. In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society, all of which are described, with no form of hierarchy, as 'integral elements of European governance' .	0.9342194198752983

Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed.	1.0629310195979822

Firstly, we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies, so that development objectives can be achieved, not merely through aid and support, but also, first and foremost, through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development.	1.079415377353519

Madam President, as you know the Cederschiöld report has been taken off Thursday' s agenda. That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday.	1.101525574449137
As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now.	1.1316360972539838
In the past the British Conservatives' double standards have brought the United Kingdom' s House of Commons into disrepute, and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament.	1.0607046668297633

Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party, the delegation of the Spanish People' s Party, with regard to Mrs Terrón i Cusí' s resolution on the area of freedom, security and justice.	0.9585113846895502
However, on a general level, I would say that in all cases it is the Structural Funds expenditure which must be additional. This is how, provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected.	1.155369625724827
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for.	0.6354062842849704

Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore.	0.9937078548495631
As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities.	0.8716785332851121
We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques.	0.8706002187392357

As intended by the Treaties and the will of the people, the Commission is the driving force of European construction which is like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement.

As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it.	1.0636619602416375

It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular.	0.9148719425348516
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.	0.3924939851524739
If the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach, then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure.	1.0222443505060905
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues.	1.1033311065311795
No one, not least my party, could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged, but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market, not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity.	1.2310777761165517
If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish' .	0.97132864562153
Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic.	0.6175620652195983

What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated.	0.6732803401204563
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.	0.8944224394832585
And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen.	0.47000904264912297
Madam President, all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture.	1.1495093486721695
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court.	0.9937840376586308
The debate is closed.	0.12489242696736869
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.	0.6154124048997414
It is very important that we include liability in that process.	0.8997815967188868
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union' s policies to date.	0.967988725595938
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions.	0.7613838771753297
If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.	1.0358616430612881
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact.	0.6605209045234839
Developing countries want trade not aid, a help up not a hand-out.	0.5778534101608283
Austria is a stable democracy; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary.	0.8459601901866313
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193, while those against republicans totalled 97.	0.4688369394439719
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.	1.1039424952365353
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union' s development, it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a charter, so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens.	1.0369101774510776
One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned.	0.9850630891860104
Mr President, Commissioner, the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans, comprehensive information and hearing rights, and close cooperation between the Member States, to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants.	0.8916043739870755
The Commission has resolutely forged a path, and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end, in the service of the citizens of Europe, to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe.	1.1286650315934068
Mr President, since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia.	1.1326964842794678
We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development.	0.529568473035344
We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas:	1.0262972942473325
On the other hand, we have voted in favour of Recital J which, in fact, is in line with what I, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, proposed to that Committee, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9136122873653444
I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties, but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Doñana.	1.0971492392436266
We have extensive services, too. We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and, not least, in European politicians here in Parliament.	0.9531491237368778
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged.	1.0087378212596227
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report.	1.1266813119467785
We believe that Helsinki was very clear in this respect.	0.7327586681488267
McNally Report (A5-0082/1999)	0.3174731011106756
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.	1.1290529074932392
Not to make war, of course, but to protect peace.	0.9956815237816112
Secondly, the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and training.	1.0330774231205542
It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society.	0.7236284959128103
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.	1.2337284258262315
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?	0.8781248128849256
Although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation, I feel that the Commission' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated.	0.978515431803745
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us. I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections.	1.0500954705020407
The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip.	1.0071150691171544
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.	0.6092335227609085
The future will show whether it is right, by means of this new parliamentary assembly, to reduce the Commission' s powers regarding these issues.	1.0079495295038157
The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional.	0.9424606233795821
(Applause)	-0.0
And just what is Mr CFSP doing?	0.40507850220311165
It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion.	0.8901064161340341
In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?	0.9135822355421608
With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation.	0.809045201655612
The various groups, be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment, have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives.	0.8925282831939535
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.	0.8570191784897503
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year, there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date.	0.7319337414468583
Many directives have already been adopted. Furthermore, the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives.	0.8910877381968813
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction.	0.6570303060833164
Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.	0.9902624731537436
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.	0.5955847249382542

I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account.	0.6591705432705066
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other. I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint.	0.9663076093514384
That is not always the case.	0.9333845260502333
It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them.	0.6972389621629494
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament.	0.8202628822029046
This also applies to whistle-blowers.	0.5966328702561785
But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided.	0.8225202711740935
The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies, and to create greater scope for coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system.	1.1126920376903515
My question, Commissioner Byrne is this: the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade.	0.7648543669818982
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy. I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.	1.088202079293983
In any case, the authoritative version is always, of course, the original language version.	0.8178887516573559
Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques.	0.561074696620963
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months.	0.7777669012632389
The report tackles stability in the region in a structural manner. This is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we are debating today.	1.12238633038735
We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions, despite the fact that, for this House, the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment: that of delaying, for five years, our role, our ability to participate actively, to democratically control this area of freedom, security and justice, as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice.	1.1185144168499144
Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments.	0.7791395110726388
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity.	0.9228363316096179
In Ireland all the major users of water, commercial, industrial and agricultural, already pay for their use of water.	0.765496039594378
We therefore consider that, in future, vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas.	0.6169980964071254
I am not speaking so much for myself, as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home.	0.9671533032330808
The European Union voted against that motion.	0.7084270490888015
You are lucky that Mr Böge' s report only deals with this on the sidelines; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so.	0.823619011836874
Commissioner, I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense, we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit.	0.9764963633740088
These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews.	0.6936557597586824
The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great strides more than properly compensates for the fact that there are, in fact, a good many cars on European roads for which they must take responsibility.	0.9518032054127908
This is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law, which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see.	1.0872001783091223
This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field.	0.7901069905299699
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights.	0.3555934497762161
However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs.	1.0526222701650085
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing.	0.7048467746620365
It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers, farmers and food operators, traceability of feed, food and ingredients, proper risk analysis through, for instance, risk assessment - that is, scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is, regulation and control - risk communication, and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate.	0.8478308173656157
My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	0.8126228085252544
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity.	0.6304219542153348
How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community, reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe?	0.7936799796189993
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13.	0.6758771208755545
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.	0.4434043337445152
If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted, my Group will abstain from the final vote.	0.71425724860701
According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors.	0.8172389230143878
I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this.	0.7866043565686988
Apparently, the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so.	1.1106537472781295
That is just the way things are, however.	0.8811946522460761
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme, because there remains a shortcoming in the report.	0.9821684863665567
Madam President, although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars, I agree with my colleague, Mr Florenz, that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included.	1.062879261891752
The Commission is in favour of codification and will, in the foreseeable future, once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative, concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version.	0.9716619227633757
That is a fact of life.	1.1074785541496794
These are serious allegations.	0.554369091379516
After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia.	1.0162897284714132
As a result, we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997, too.	1.1128094226228429
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.	0.9298245852810638
Moreover, they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind.	0.843781084716732
This is wrong!	0.32195032148431924
I hope the delegation has an excellent visit to Strasbourg.	0.8119928353285452
In consequence, I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects, particularly those of an infrastructural kind.	0.9292646610690146
We might then see an end to some of the fraud, corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped.	0.7826781660362523
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for, or advising, the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level.	0.8128984276699981
Does not the Council' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process?	1.0154577455659801
Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies.	1.100000370388924
Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble.	1.0354144838129618
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April.	1.1001006108036964
From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president.	0.928574619562837
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men' s lives.	0.6191090636359129
However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions.	1.1154165518324215
For that reason, the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity, which has nothing to do with the real economy.	0.8534215730829846
Mr President, it feels quite strange to be standing here again today, as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years, and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence, and not by force majeure.	1.0931604709381635
First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.	1.1159424029912566
I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region.	0.8524780971524847
We need a framework of regulations at international level.	0.8902881172927416
The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does.	1.0226149990893472
Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon.	1.203968906972504
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.	0.6324147237495917
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs.	0.8092152525492402
I come, of course, from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries.	0.9404234453442497
More women in decision-making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well.	0.5667944247188861
We have failed to achieve a qualified majority.	0.639749717972655
For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action.	1.3027076206495287
The efforts already being made need to be stepped up.	0.534954372393935
If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia.	1.193873727125277
When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support.	0.7933594738675844
Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union.	1.0071089133075175
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout.	1.0592226406017973
The Commission can, in principle, also approve Amendment No 4 which ought, however, to be introduced into another place in the text.	1.1327152626106225
Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable.	1.0694670924425156
This clarification would certainly meet with our approval.	0.3365409228162499
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too.	0.9354610506770674
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing.	0.5069858197645861
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules.	1.0472590655412113
For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments.	1.2349345736258537
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.	0.7767429021611579
Where is the beef?	0.3231005580223244
That should be the starting point for our efforts.	0.8189415219744276
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.	0.765093248586164
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing.	1.0630192610283131
We should get it into perspective.	0.5148455671325376
Moving on now, then, to the point where there is (or, I hope, was) a lack of agreement, namely OTC derivatives.	1.1711370840986688
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.	0.6663330714294167
We have no difficulty with the "polluter pays" principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial, commercial and agricultural level.	0.7497741921977885
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control.	0.8391778307099487
Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree, things may be different with this report.	0.9700635141119107
The reason is as follows: this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union.	0.8548335902187874
The directive remains in place.	0.3057826558493091
The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures.	0.8053899913474134
This condition of accrual is essential since, in my opinion, the principle of nulla poena sine lege, legality in criminal law, must be observed.	0.6824532811094746
It is not the European Parliament' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the European Union' s 15 Member States are to remain in place and which are to be shut down; to expand their work forces or reduce them; stay in the same location or else move; be sold or not be sold; and, in the case of those which are to be sold, to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside Europe.	0.9417600505137266
Nevertheless, rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons.	0.5125847319878919
Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision.	0.7255039048287336
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration.	0.9261300174557574
Perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of entente cordiale.	0.756604593846558
However, to focus on the European Union as it is today, and on the subject of government and governance - a word which, at least in Spanish, brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, although it may be an appropriate word anyway -, the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government, and, since President Prodi always defends his home town, Bologna, I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand: the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which speak of bon governo [good government] and mal governo [bad government].	1.0192507810016362

I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.	1.3772472803856795
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund, which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal, especially for countries like Greece.	1.159227193547127
Macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people' s lives, specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes, particularly of the minimum pensions, and through fighting social exclusion.	0.9220020848246587
Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas.	0.6251219718570122

Europe' s role: we first need to emphasise that Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict: only then can we talk of the 'military' role of the Union.	0.8036986295035006
First allow me to point out, Commissioner Byrne, that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative.	1.146859418829832
I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the region' s reconciliation process and - why not? - new discussions on relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I think calls for a change in the existing UN Charter.	0.9360736423463447
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics.	1.010703774345221
I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority.	0.49620976757091656

Water and air surround us everywhere.	0.3854296628103103
That does not apply to Austria alone.	0.706113141520269
These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty.	1.3153406728841213
In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.	1.0782629731110962
There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach.	1.2236841096674353

Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.	0.9814320733408014
Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest.	0.9261959150824466
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes.	0.9310227114077405
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems.	0.699413392468065

Let me point out, in passing, that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is also a Council member, and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role, alongside the Heads of State and Government, particularly during the final period.	0.9809312569029733
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.	0.6422023433812939
This is what we are doing and we are committed to this.	1.2121975672223775
Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.	0.9228404765861119
I remember your predecessor' s speech five years ago.	0.5406347502076728
My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light.	0.4740911206899609
One such area is tourism which, by its very nature, is very much a national concern.	1.1129579812017578
These programmes promoted cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area.	0.7226226879383824
Certainly the process has always been very complex, as a result of historical decisions, and these must eventually be rationalised.	0.9712318555786903
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need.	0.7636762873928986
(SV) This is a very important question.	1.0886831418078946
In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave.	0.9393689196563408
Of course, it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport, services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement.	0.8856865483134226
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending.	0.9235923560266127
I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution.	0.8165955266622519
Repeating my thanks to each and every one of you, and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrière, I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar: only EUR 700 million for URBAN, but this is better than nothing; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTERREG.	0.970051479078941
Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights.	0.838053100156966
Mr President, before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me.	0.9233394735903623
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking, and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech, which is available in four languages.	0.8970658321401264
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation.	0.27340925423692397

The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.	1.093896865128903
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic.	0.7351319035007555
However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs.	1.1512938575135485
Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' être. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly.	0.867581494153032
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed.	0.6370778458746865
I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence, enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure.	0.8301569303334706
We cannot accept this.	0.7030029706644938
Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for.	0.6863565430752747
And any remaining skeletons, I intend to leave them in the cupboard.	0.7917402485657992

During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.	0.6889964436092224
This, of course, does not mean that, if the economic climate is less than favourable, the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly. It means that, in the long and medium term, there should be a balance or surplus.	1.0622229611429224

It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.	0.4541475808327474
Mr President, most of the time, the European Parliament, spearheaded by environment committees, does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council, so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view.	0.953616021740371
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative, they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity.	0.7488383396095757
Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right.	0.891935973212898
At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.	0.9943835920832926

I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid.	0.9767567257448879
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.	1.010201453284107
This is the citizen of a state' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy.	1.1471351666070653
Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy.	0.8868922180283425
You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty, insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency.	0.5881663556634794
Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate.	1.1652773967762071
The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years.	0.6810304844797938
Mr President, I beg your pardon, but the French interpreter made a small error, on the most sensitive word in the debate, during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said.	1.0064399272578581
But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.	1.0481434043711537
The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least, therefore, to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy. Otherwise, the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing.	0.9888177207788357

At the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June, the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago.	0.851353362091856
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed. Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.	1.2005974713460443
I endorse this view.	0.47370522481258626

Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe.	1.0809400072570405

And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community.	1.1242416589781186
That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks.	0.8114359504194516
The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves, and as Mr Andersson knows, this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity.	1.131744482004496
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate.	0.8961474188587947
I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies, and that, together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission, they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union.	1.1195152843900624

I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked.	0.9554685010578672
They may, therefore, continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation, where there are no applicable European standards.	0.6441726944111443
I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well.	0.8539103951901806
Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom.	1.01009315724558

The European Union must take the initiative and must also, as demanded in the motion, propose this initiative to the G7 because it is primarily a political question.	1.1819582051462825

The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement.	0.9189957922511041

When will you make it compulsory?	0.6162298025887899
The challenge of enlargement is political.	0.7229257889322502
We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.	1.0413292189160352

We therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of Bolshevism or Nazism. Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong, but also listening to their explanations.	0.7213217380649194
On the other hand, we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe, which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon, and a European Union at the service of the citizens.	1.087167788227874

I do, however, think it appropriate to say that, at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement, the European side must point out to the Skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will, so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in New York.	1.097239420112211

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative, and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourrière' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, with the Commission' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector, a sector in which many associations, especially cynegetic, are already making enormous investments in my own country.	0.9309145913618939

For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.	0.8014815356970212
- (FR) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitled 'Women and Science' .	0.897255961459943
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.	0.8164462375785427
We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that Jörg Haider stands for.	0.8156717419764552
The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives, which brings me back to the subject of our discussion. I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate, particularly to fight against demagoguery.	0.9699841836468082
We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently.	0.808118932415427
Turning to the report, we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata, or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation.	0.9809962535042497
I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday, should not adopt a stance on this matter.	0.9097756966030811
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF.	1.119750657296239

Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber.	0.8773109206757838
Do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard?	0.6742940116766253
It is clear that electronic mail, electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future.	0.759779601539902
(Loud applause)	0.16271248253873916
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue.	0.9596970692211668
We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places.	1.2173039685189235
That it is what we are doing.	1.1636350388027425
Even within my group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion.	0.9020580957041301
We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates.	0.789237265009495
My final point is this.	0.43559169474463577
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.	1.020999858251067
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point.	0.5755443310618981
As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification.	0.9391206131464842
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.	1.002476206266222
However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.	1.1778775591208566
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review.	0.8656537347880562
Incidentally, this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council, since it was just one, the Netherlands, which was responsible for that intransigence.	1.223684092165732
It is important that, in time, there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries.	1.0128825474959415
We are familiar with Parliament' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council' s legal advisers.	1.0135948980951683

Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living.	0.4011383554895673
In Finland surface waters are very clean.	0.4180615346485305
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections?	0.4649216190138805
We must take the best from each of our countries.	1.061993615292665
A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy.	0.6429051420108558
This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future.	0.9716405354520997
It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions.	1.2020395807027273
Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament.	1.1887834360564427
However, the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political, social and personal problem with incalculable consequences.	0.8468933949730795
This public prosecutor would have the authority, recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States, to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests.	0.8639893919451652
This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	0.6108531604898035
We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.	0.7583969482359635
(The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.)	0.4489153782115723
On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction.	0.8626004026009005
I am very fond of him.	0.7255212194611967
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which, although it does not mention it in the text, appears to be an attempt to revive, as the introduction has done, the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin, which our Group opposed, clearly and totally, during the last legislature, with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President, Mr Cox.	1.0882209843599842
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU, we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth, and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating, especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth.	0.8804371960455389
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny.	0.7753403339856609
I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste.	0.6974703450116848
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis.	0.7744160499680126
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label.	0.9704934879997782
If there are such rules, who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility?	0.886382655260531
A new government has come into power in Austria, comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis-à-vis minorities.	0.6413632089786083
Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force.	0.819652557433709
I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might, to use a French expression, préjuger the Portuguese Presidency' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the Statute for Members.	1.0393351985489643
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention, as far as possible, with your support, of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social, human and territorial cohesion, particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe, a Europe of wealthy districts but, at the same time, a Europe of impoverished areas.	1.0677322949915333
I hope that has an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talks.	0.7949522981508086
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.	0.8413693959101438
We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified.	0.7225365939508934
It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent.	0.5818222542276901
I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds.	0.9267370889071755
But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU.	0.7969886229327747
I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists.	1.2144267252915757
A5-0012/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established in the Community (COM(1999)3 - C4-0096/1999 - 1999/0013(CNS)).	0.7199136460369819
Nevertheless, despite these aspects, European citizens are disappointed and concerned: by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough; by a Europe trailing behind in technology, and seemingly falling even further behind, and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times, starting with the Commission itself.	0.9742695036078506
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.	0.8261154381408916
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.	1.0616601658707439
They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population.	0.7967862589359807
The consequences do not inspire hope.	0.36214345881512827
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.	0.8604300162202735
As with all other Community initiatives, this is very positive.	0.9577658115227579
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services.	0.9391346544123618
In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model' s approach, which is one based on solidarity.	1.055591620999504
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.	0.7666161659460251
However, it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern.	1.1594238940218482
The common position is not ambitious enough.	0.78994409575539
The European Union prefers to send its funds to Eastern Europe, the former USSR and Asia, where there is greater opportunity for profit.	0.9228391208813449
Think of specialist, national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court.	0.7267874085804559
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David' s Day.	0.6476755139414744
The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres.	0.9953294054061553
On one hand, this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country. This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs.	0.7895689615127619
The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions.	0.8543942079409297
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created, I would like to say, first, that there is, via the Social Fund, an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement, i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.	0.8513892346516523
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics.	0.8474231525206146
Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.	1.119619947797782
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents.	0.6986821938497102
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver.	0.730916412320891
It is most worrying, especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be taking shape.	0.9447080799271236
Or their Socialist back-up troops who, in this House, have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats?	0.8400025002693419
Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition.	1.0169787955396787
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?	0.5938128909029184
Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.	1.0469236774224502
It is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non-EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum-seekers, whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU.	0.813916802762485
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission.	0.8035059126470353
I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Commissioner: does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign?	0.9301630838867441
There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR.	0.7428494336173125
Madam President, Representative of the Council, Commissioner, a week ago, the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm.	0.9126481260765255
However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against.	1.0248425415387479
This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds, such as those listed in Objective 1, might welcome this type of installation.	0.794832203493091
Finally, with the emergence, the resurgence, of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination, and Article 137 to combat exclusion.	0.9465729272456272
Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.	1.0977200606178175
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy.	0.7413625242034261
It is therefore noticeable that 'equality', 'gender' and 'women' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	0.8141506333628701
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.	0.809573459925537
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States.	0.7482656235398238
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	0.39380114041270825
In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected.	0.8881824687632158
I believe that this first half of the year, in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council, provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration.	0.9732672341939291
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world' s currency markets. This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services.	0.7476043821085886
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated.	0.4552891336484533
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions.	0.7965802714770854
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself.	1.064244302313766
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.	0.4053949523949289
Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.	1.066319404964308
Lastly, his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render ISD activities.	0.7998616186819645
Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources.	0.8969138108313122

The time for action is upon us.	0.6127561204831523
As a result, smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another.	0.4918927718456221
We would like to know their names and their faces.	0.7580605071382333
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us.	0.7497841767377766
For us in Finland, a sparsely populated country, a visit to the post office is a social event.	1.0622338112241065
I am not a warmonger, but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo, then what is the point in having soldiers at all?	1.1665875090586382
(FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy.	0.7588156157078791
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included, particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included, other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference' s agenda.	0.9995457078470056
By taking action in the field of culture, we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul, especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up "Culture 2000" are superb.	0.8231478361857171
I can show you a copy if you wish.	0.6048854036206428
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively.	0.9577763325481162
For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener.	0.9588139141085786
I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends.	0.866850139794009
We do not think so.	0.7974705235162204
Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question.	0.9112337686629214
There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca, who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate.	0.941427857353815
Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency, particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future, given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level.	1.2371614259967505
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit, but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible.	0.9620718277781938
In addition, this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital, which is one of the central tenets of the internal market.	0.927393791696306
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions.	1.0809714057649948
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine.	0.9040274749664728
Let us not forget that, to date, LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum, i.e. scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union.	0.709405157259129
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade.	1.0255147802661444
In other words, we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content.	0.7107384945660187
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.	0.9863891130821741
These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie.	0.6989181678915143
We hope that we can count on the support of Parliament, and - why not say it - of the Council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives, so that the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible, thus allowing us all to contribute, in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, to the realisation of this project, which is, without a doubt, the "jewel in the crown" of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.0940264210406752
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this.	0.8073462017753817
Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates.	0.9194748694544418
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the "dead" car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process.	0.6515788793427161
In particular, the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure, deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure, oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission.	0.7285559639832568
Mr Goebbels, I am sorry, but I think you are jumping the gun; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words 'with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale' be moved. You were asking for the place to be changed.	0.9645795111986796
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.	1.1165335505242797
Moreover, this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well.	1.1304691379102794
In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position.	1.036892022391483
With regard to the present agreement, both these conditions are fulfilled.	0.980703986795266
Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment, the debate we had was not the easiest one.	1.070403673027503
For the time, the report grew too large when it was being debated.	0.9997746181611529
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.759299144196129
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation.	0.7755682039648355
This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far.	0.8073788524976148
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel, because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex, both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue.	0.996890141091477
Question No 39 by (H-0036/00):	0.2310225436370847
This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship.	0.5428217619548901
Secondly, I would like to explode a myth, taking as a starting point an apparent paradox, which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures: the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, but on the contrary the most advanced nations, whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features.	0.9097165997077828
I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on.	0.666697543410294
Most importantly though, we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform, not just of the WTO but also of the ILO, the United Nations and above all, of the financial institutions, specifically the IMF and the World Bank.	1.1031164463769552
This is not new.	0.7302135980782242
However, these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared.	0.7794548815316945
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to present to you certain information about the re-opening of the intra-Cyprus negotiations and recent developments in this area.	0.9424410885505758
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists.	0.5455896465629925
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor' s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU.	1.0978312384633166
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests.	1.0442878183793562
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission, so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure.	1.0327452041327374
What kind of measures does the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the European institutions in similar cases?	0.9917358879790892
It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session.	0.9811415317615836
Finally, on the subject of technical assistance, on which your rapporteur and several of you commented. It goes without saying that the Commission will adhere to the terms of Article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance, if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general.	1.0989330564145643
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic.	0.47686764610098653
The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism.	0.7277367946296424
We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats.	1.086883967399217
Let us mention, for example, the disturbing lack of public interest, the definition of monetary policy objectives abusively reduced to the mere fight against inflation, the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism, the status of the present applicant countries, when they become members, vis-à-vis the euro zone, the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation, and so on. Do I also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20% since 1 January 1999, 40% if they bought bonds, and no less than 55% if they sold yen to buy euros?	0.8863391557842609
For this reason, 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU' s institutions respond to our citizens' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement, with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection.	0.9667964006696127
This Intergovernmental Conference will, at the outset, concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate, particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.	0.9180081106333572
It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems.	1.0051483635338834
I think ours is a different approach!	0.5631345379507168
This communication must contain a clear timetable.	0.4546569894154147
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.	0.9536187324066436
The Commission' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met, and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging.	1.0237433884079463
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.	0.8479573650734328
Let there be no doubt about it: we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of "big brother" and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods.	0.7840159730979321
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated.	0.9396440272786187
This is largely due to historical factors.	0.4430540315907948
So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue.	1.1245269681680177
This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region.	0.9144667467754243
Not a euro more or a euro less.	0.5086473320533492
However, we have to work within the existing legislative framework.	1.212786236992298
However, let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues: the death penalty, Cuba and China.	0.7881737406836227
Mr President, when it comes to putting its own house in order, the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation.	0.9922488817049481
The document is unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament, and to members of the Austrian national parliament, and it smacks slightly of jealousy and political interests, but also of business.	1.1534990749062355
One of the EU' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners.	0.9197051334981217
Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade.	0.6626593266915428
Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents.	1.2051527265342499
I end by stressing the need for the European Union to persist with such initiatives, which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions, and to foster their harmonious development.	1.0856507316002844
As I said at the beginning, the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council last December have had a visible impact on the way the positions of the various parties to this process have developed.	1.1379351342714383
I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almería and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own.	0.9379288852937653
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities.	0.7387134950970728
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.	0.9221871968818968
Madam President, the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities.	0.9241844089455982
Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban.	0.9938471755016525
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael programmes.	0.5088449362237842
The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities, and does not require prior Commission approval.	1.0925724130036203
I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality.	0.9224492973544842
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?	1.1414271953615547
What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation.	0.8165341643123812
Subject: Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU.	0.8781074055399024
What you just said is absolutely true: people want more engaged democracy.	0.5151464843928957
However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe.	1.0349533943452682
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm.	0.7402888965044664
Three comments: the first is based on the fact that women are able. I can, therefore all women can.	1.3144772508242246
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible.	0.972959785650651
Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a full member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, it has been invited to G7 and is a client of the IMF and the World Bank.	1.128683961966125
My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks.	1.1112003251936855
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.	0.8991972313155269
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.	1.0413718911890244
This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.	1.1936721111522244
(The Minutes were adopted)	0.4968428240015588
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme.	0.812015254409963
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States.	1.0523442287289628
Instead, it should leave Member States to develop their own systems, and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good.	1.1086888599950946
However, the EU' s present policy in the Balkans is fragmentary, inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature.	0.9660218600661891
The reasons for adjustments are, for example, to improve employment, reduce social security expenditure, but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria.	0.89823088995627
For that reason, we shall vote against both these proposals.	0.8798330808885483
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ. On the contrary, they will strengthen them.	0.9735565058747808
Nowadays, there are many, perhaps too many, treaties on human rights. If those treaties remain mere expressions, they are no more than useless depositories of people's thoughts.	1.0337194107779784
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine, we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday.	1.053035097426783
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind.	0.8587293469029045
- (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem.	1.0803486501851722
The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years.	0.7082192906858179
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents.	0.7609830376577735
We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy.	0.7295857289631296
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent.	0.7448235465212502
'No freedom for the enemies of freedom' was what the advocates of the revolutionary Terror were saying two centuries ago, the advocates of the revolution which proved, alas, to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes.	0.7708639951969872
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation.	0.9001403031560602
What expectations does the Commissioner have that the new Intergovernmental Conference which is starting will include this aspect?	0.7335865805257653
We believe that justice should be done in this case, but this is not the most appropriate procedure.	1.3496311987839968
Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo.	0.8373185385788461
If such implementing measures are referred back, it should be to both branches, not to one branch alone.	1.0507759125215743
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required.	0.8374083332689792
Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year?	0.8665381639019913
I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power.	0.8361695709257998
Mr President, Commissioner, this morning on French national radio, I heard that liberalisation of the French postal service was now only a matter of days or hours away and that it was irreparable, like the developments with our neighbours in Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany.	1.0494586830681345
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues.	0.7943421674851256
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project, more resources would, moreover, be required than are available in the present situation.	0.8011114162843485
You can be satisfied with the progress made.	0.8264132074378205
Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan, where a great deal of the fighting is still going on, with weapons, no less, funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are?	0.9100213229588195
Brussels knows best.	0.07490563342665739
By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.	0.9551099854311036
Finally, I should like to make three additional comments, quite briefly, Mr President.	1.0734330429127612
I know what I am talking about and I will conclude by telling you why I am so glad we are holding this debate!	0.8815009210053151
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union.	0.7187827256407089
Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge.	0.6976474268340259
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this.	0.892011818722311
On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF, also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion, by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion.	0.9056705424473218
We have been told how, currently, people's time is being wasted and that the changes, therefore, could be beneficial.	0.8221570462158132
The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic.	1.1251394876622993
Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view.	0.7774347357973009
Allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now, because I have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and "cherished" cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3, 7, and 9, section 2, and 35.	1.0364956669586982
Women are no homogenous collective.	0.3403516552568333
It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide.	1.1757726546676959
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.	0.9916558020353178
It may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the European Union and third-country nationals meeting certain conditions.	0.9154408162746208
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south.	0.9762742480540546
Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive.	0.7946989694733617
That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve.	0.946130534915479
The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income.	0.8293430479265588
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament.	0.7388346142686485
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.	0.9557819295411204
Unfortunately not all, but many of them travel the world to see its marvels and to discover and learn more about it: Italians want to see what the English are like, the Greeks want to see what the Turks are like and the French want to see their Italian cousins.	0.9751565180779209
The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed.	0.8076540677302779
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as I understood it, Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still.	0.8372283377133332
Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes.	0.9999286637283088
For example, I have today received information directly from Rafael Marques, whose situation we are discussing, according to which two correspondents from Portuguese television have been imprisoned in Angola.	0.7301257984885522
We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour.	0.9463550655935007
What is now needed is action.	0.5303114218879397
There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies.	0.691300367922477
We are losing market share.	0.5264924453297594
This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research.	0.8731826928311572
As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights' section.	0.9869486586424461
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.	0.5080543785196183
I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance.	0.9946020093223557
The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries.	0.871571155154114
We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments.	0.9134290379452453
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola.	0.809548338392048
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved?	0.8653136928293707
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.	1.0140197037475929
As for the time scale demanded for the directive' s implementation, it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive' s implementation will take time and considerable resources.	1.03116695785564
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Council.	0.9416276822831704
I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.9415768267007301
This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading!	0.7169496969050791
The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.	0.8395323067062159
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy.	0.7331446768523825
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.	1.1835025803858716
It is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries will be visiting Morocco on 20 to 22 March.	0.6162381072741293
President Prodi, today you have presented the Commission' s five-year programme, and it has many objectives that we endorse.	1.023476790383814
It is not just a question of style.	0.8293317617918388
Nevertheless, as you know, this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further.	1.4884391948853297
We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons.	0.8414162015966702
It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty.	1.061230044285265
We need to clarify the liability for transactions.	0.6558910761069029
The economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level.	0.6944294735340857
But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel.	0.8401434207714275
On their course towards accession, the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal, but stand to lose even more.	0.8235460990401887
Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant.	1.0526236441065522
This could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs.	0.9439763020773732
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism.	0.6097251527493138
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials' with 'government officials' .	0.5074409237901308
The first is concerned with conflict resolution.	0.9554638320658226
In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations, both in the public sector and in the private sector, in the last decade or so.	0.8100773793202425
However, there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives.	0.6233554787246708
Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all.	0.7646530338685773
With regard to INTERREG, we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation.	1.1191811697788987
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this.	0.8567038211653263
- (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no.	0.6757787652750183
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.	0.9972557757083302
The Commission' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous, for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements.	0.9124934392995157
I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent, regardless of who was involved in that work.	0.7584593790800858
The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now, given the time needed for ratification in Member States' parliaments.	0.8858673497250869
In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?	0.9436023685393145
They are still in training, as it were.	1.042662324660812
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard.	0.9843096168493071
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.	1.0457813160694682
Article 34, a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only lays down the new form of a framework decision, and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union.	1.1157863266196908
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis.	0.6882615419001753
In addition, and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system, the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key" as Herr Bösch said, established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts.	1.0729175510935485
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):	0.2959011987176787
It seems contradictory.	0.31146318064816025
If you want to combat xenophobia and racism, and I believe that we should, we need to look at the root causes.	1.1889325900622916
Also the following points are unacceptable for us: joint investigation teams, controlled deliveries, undercover investigations, inaccuracy of the text on the scope of the convention, lack of respect of the principle of proportionality, lack of democratic guarantees.	0.8594402326382344
We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action.	0.9652310489590001
As Parliament, we are, of course, expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this, which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten, as has almost happened already.	1.0589930186420202
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency.	0.5782706334554485
The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part.	0.9381407793689405
We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union, and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate, with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country.	0.9124270233392411
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.	0.8615352924729949
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States.	1.0563999044425716
This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, which we also understand.	0.8275970744655131
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0125/2000) by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the UN Commission on human rights	0.7935907853267601
Mr President, I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and, in common with others, express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence.	1.0580309840421938
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.	1.1603223806137861
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments.	0.6359360899736013
You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.	0.9296941586304113
Firstly, the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the Commission' s programme.	0.9033627263282296
We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action.	0.8535567068729368
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful?	0.5807085408193264
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.	0.9702474185887872
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way.	0.8973792152412974
We are talking about us, not Austria.	0.8724788840727727
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.	0.8164966118647109
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process.	0.8081014768806651
The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies.	0.8672720746238456
Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known.	1.1594965827144068
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.	0.7366944238861363
Mr President, I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission's White Paper on food safety, adopted on Wednesday last, 12 January, in association with my colleague, Mr Liikanen.	1.0097180479917003
Let us beware, too, of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application.	0.8414387510315171
A question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies.	1.1379200243724201
We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved.	0.6993276412078541
Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms.	0.5788872779976361
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision.	1.065807154511448
Relating to Friday: President.	0.42804706166702466
I believe that is a good thing	1.1581748610497586
The position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the European Union and Turkey and between Greece and Turkey will bear favourably on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations.	1.0037693581714449
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	0.8408392320524786
Mr President, I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so.	0.8171582413207011
Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocols, and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe, in particular on cyber crime.	1.1555905123616763
A proposal can be made, a proposal should be made, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, by the middle of this year.	1.1567742305814146
We would ask the Council and the Commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights.	0.9496956739705424
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)	0.7660010853486784
That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player.	1.0923338868936976
Mr Di Pietro' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict.	0.8225525823786041
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	0.7134904245129217
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.	0.9438774825070224
However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people.	1.245348939943591
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet.	1.1093023134184423
Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda.	0.7056183747004557
I also thank the Working Groups on the small island states and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent reports.	0.6246944709358918
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.	0.9730474934969039
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance.	0.9849897681202834
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations.	1.0092487357146278
In the limited time available for this statement, it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals.	0.9217825891903275
URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, in Moss Side.	0.9173964978691292
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.	0.5899238638818358
I cannot see a reason, therefore, why a further extension for this measure should be proposed.	0.7964081588193616
It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork. Excessive paperwork.	0.9823259146885832
B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party,	0.7030770165529455
It is clear that this is primarily an issue for the IGC and one that addresses an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the Council and the Commission.	0.9173026679847321
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.	0.8438185917724971
We have a new Commission.	1.1273350928318295
The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform.	0.9433415281326613
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect.	0.7689145793192247
b) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels	0.5356076322936668
It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo.	0.9188132791666705
Health facilities and staff of NGOs need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients.	0.7297416441608028
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny.	0.5131586214169415
Forgive me Mr Poos.	0.12391506655806292
Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice.	1.0022342909514868
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	0.7968643533563481
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants.	0.7971827019509302
Thirdly, the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand.	0.8301437671670532
At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter.	0.9620445327131867
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead, partially at least, to exclusion.	0.829441783468299
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.	0.8858152774767785
Thank you, Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council.	0.6944688524655103
It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union.	0.7956210592578415
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate.	0.6372265611831659
The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do, in the best case, moderate some partial problems of the countryside, which are of secondary importance, but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience.	1.0312586596981261
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.	0.8677752354678528
There is no legal basis, and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector.	1.1587754829429682
However, before the elections we - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens.	1.1500106818434264
Looking at Amendment No 7, for example, which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances, you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic.	0.9044137111575007
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance, at last, of the ban on degassing at sea.	0.8927873162006229
We are not going to enter into a debate now.	0.9049256262348538
I thought that it was quite superb.	0.7466588242736774
We value our public service, our universal postal service, because we know, and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens, that the citizens value this service and the Commission undertook, during Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, to maintain this universal service throughout the European Union.	1.029067352903919
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.	0.9176506602387099
There is still more we have to do, and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that.	1.3216006029626202
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.	1.0510848870171212
Firstly, when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal.	0.9167965845626033
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence.	0.7523745245110114
Cuba has observer status but I understand has now shown a wish to join the ACP.	0.6992529799584426
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.	0.9615982719333293
In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate.	0.8307197999900299
Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria.	1.2033417379003641
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country, Israel, does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility.	0.9399161604311934
Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples.	1.0259645772410428
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too.	0.8594160211352309
We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years' time.	0.8575324933301486
We in the European Union are one Community.	0.9622519074695491
(Applause)	-0.0
Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen.	0.6484053435334635
I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy.	0.5033495813783015
All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform.	1.0152969149152247
What kind of horse-trading system is this?	0.4262269789525976
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.	0.35621669037584747
I think, therefore, that paragraph 7 contains something very central, i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies.	0.7350562781800961
You said in your summary, Commissioner Prodi, that liberalisation, competitiveness, keeping inflation low, innovation, science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs.	1.12791826824969
This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue.	0.772066013872092
What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	1.0323939201231471
Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece.	1.141459281070197
I just wanted to make it clear - as it has been translated differently here - that we always use the official name FYROM.	1.0785121857591922
I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country, Denmark, takes it for granted that, when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union, we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth, that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe.	0.9050635018244352
Firstly, the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors, with the backing of the European Investment Bank.	1.0579022095772643
Clearly, many citizens are 'disenchanted and anxious' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems, such as unemployment and social exclusion, which affect our very existence. This must be one of our absolute priorities.	0.927081192503854
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency.	0.9844277959687305
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life.	0.8465619631845172
Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances.	0.9744690900005814
(Applause)	-0.0
I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector.	0.744205267447969
But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue.	0.872885913862501
I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less.	0.7867943180627761
Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage, increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues.	0.7643490674991875
We should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war.	0.7184059741878276
We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary.	0.9115625568949806
We wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the Member States, even if the enlargement of the EU requires a greater degree of coordination than there has been in the past.	1.0373939042939235
If civilian targets were targeted and destroyed, killing civilians is illegal by anyone's standards.	0.39551034451500144
It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU.	0.956189737125902
As important is the fact that Austria' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country.	0.9277159692435046
At any rate, the Commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union.	0.9718262816307481
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation.	1.031833685668878
This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective.	0.8154813350210073
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?	0.3266887134204012
Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now.	1.0168890570985012
Mr President, yesterday' s Minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so-called 'Strasbourg Declaration" which intends to implicate the European Parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that I am a Nazi.	0.9399316893116597
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?	0.5608015066260705
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union's food safety regime.	1.0086576716717852
The regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries, including your own, must act as an example to others. These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords, an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation, rendering them modern-day slaves.	0.6726430169019741
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.45619659166680016
We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence.	0.6061779054724876
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life.	0.5992443328883059
On the other hand, quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life.	0.858854541465404
The new legal framework will cover animal feed, animal health and welfare, hygiene, contaminants and residues, novel food, additives, flavourings, packaging and irradiation.	0.5722780344478287
That concludes the debate.	0.1493340915838452
However, if it is a union of culture, civilisation and participation, then it becomes a living thing.	1.0160189350539997
On one point of detail, I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for having clarified, for example, the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion.	0.8454488673897618
They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy.	0.5664576037591512
The Commission' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation.	0.8518205052184911
There are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding.	0.6573203719748206
Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.	0.871795828195727
In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings.	0.8508751597773179
Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease.	1.0145884185866811
Indeed, enlargement, which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete, objective criteria, and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater degree, public opinion in our own Member States.	1.1936483938811873
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them.	0.9619365336617971
Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses, because they managed to recycle certain materials, even materials which are not yet included in the directive.	1.0342019510677973
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils.	0.7921152784100134
Members of this House will have differing views, even within the same political parties, depending on (a) which country they come from or (b) which committee they sit on.	0.9355232690675706
I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance.	1.1214710948120596
In accordance with Article 246 of the Treaty, the auditing of accounts is carried out by the Court of Auditors which, to this end, studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions. The Court also guarantees proper financial management.	0.8652010105435096
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal.	0.5504648689494434
The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned.	0.4602821322104389
Having said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum, the very least we could do.	1.1173103745788147
I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time.	1.3694036753648215
Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.	1.2021981432424231
I would suggest that there is a solution.	0.952932717819011
It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin.	1.0188493034679167
Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.	0.9439521194609095
For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States.	0.9656389041507683
I am, up to a point, concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.	0.9440896686482184
No. Clearly, we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment, but it will be very much greater.	1.2727008800288588
What other explanation could there be for omitting women?	0.35279059449983835
But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results.	0.9117806690893532
It is thus not confined to EC activities.	0.6470551547466193

The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants.	0.553176759844265
If that does not meet with a positive response, the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed, not just by the Commission, but by this Parliament and by the Council too.	1.1484462952404848
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres, the tax havens, of which there are 62 in all.	0.9157006829572831
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints.	0.9088317833793514
Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group, we tabled a motion for a resolution.	0.7803258864006486
(IT) I shall now quickly turn, Mr President, to Mr Rapkay' s report, and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission' s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy.	1.111052596958543
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided, we must say that external offices will be used.	0.9892144996703717
I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name.	0.8629034988630901
Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies.	0.8593151518865407
Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C, interregional cooperation.	0.9320812376385413
I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions.	0.8084137187349686
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament' s plenary sitting today that Europe' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions.	0.8617715697587224
I should also like to refer to the darker side of tourism, the tourism exported from the Member States of the European Union. I am referring to sex tourism.	0.9159364229238384
But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality.	1.0183430889601055
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government?	0.8421597582814606
However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.	1.0955357469458047
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th.	0.8269696424373059
Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards.	1.057485448726585
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.	1.079622775050912
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union.	0.8867146292917809
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.	1.1456089007070447
It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles, our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries.	0.8112347265392723
Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values, which truly respect gender differences, not on some postulated sexual equality, which has its own intrinsic contradictions. In any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy, based on the use of quotas, contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by, and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally' s report, namely women' s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit.	1.0130114983576697
Once again, Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants.	0.7326642696675928
These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities.	0.8361931943936597

This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it.	0.4952227191409572
In anticipation of this EU directive' s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied.	0.807173835654383
Even in Tampere, we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality.	0.7829391082314472
Sometimes the more we speak, the less we hear - motions: words; conventions: words; treaties: words - if we are not careful, words themselves become a substitute for real action.	0.9226504444887416
Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission, only time will tell.	0.9434346956901222
The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates.	0.9179486291600958
That concludes the debate.	0.2933191749311639
We are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion, especially in the sparsely populated rural areas, one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning.	1.041482917154342
We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have.	0.9393976032377391
I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.	1.1201300042501845
It is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion, the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments, those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high-risk funds.	0.8343274782040087
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997.	1.09954564919857
There are few things more certain in life than taxes, death and pollution.	0.48627931484859865
And there are more and more of us in the world.	0.9407148318178236
Taking these aspects into account, I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind, as proposed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF.	1.061782919775837
It is very important, if we stress that Europe is to be a Europe of values, that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends.	1.1828021941530347
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.	0.6995247501631842
We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1, but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks.	0.9095249373223295
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.	0.9231415747555791
Mr President, Commissioner, we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide-ranging problems we are trying to eliminate.	0.8084261243780339
We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni.	0.7354798570922428
I will end by congratulating Mr Viceconte and, as one who comes from Crete, a tourist area, I ask that we should always view tourism not only in terms of pleasant holidays but as a primary job creator in a Europe which needs those jobs.	0.9926332069410622
As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of 'polluter pays' must be applied.	0.9853231439472355
This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe.	0.8911618535276149
Mr President, I would like to try to put a different perspective to this.	0.8288878238103343
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place.	0.9973305678507418
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.	0.8649541801251606

Madam President, could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other?	0.9075868655363136
(The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor.	0.6271156827870825
Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world' s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe' s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round.	1.0247634409846094
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.	0.8141496336860119
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III.	0.8978153778591073
Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services -, this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement, to perfect a more coherent political union.	1.0982901023208949
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.	0.936913042677041
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally.	1.0097351117443034
On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance.	1.1128680949613905

Question No 42 by (H-0026/00):	0.3093278638756913
These are thus extremely important questions, which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion.	1.124719112424116
This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations.	1.0272208582852338
Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.	0.8854159411149427
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland.	0.860608887533449
This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital.	0.6586703430563124
What is the Council's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project?	1.03433084096991
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats.	0.5782563625439553
Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.	0.994186615636625
I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly' s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria.	0.9590950606033217
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ.	0.5799414910960455
We cannot agree to this, since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States.	0.736198549050272
Regarding the situation in Carinthia, we need to look at this in detail.	1.0935582778445718

During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006, other EU initiatives such as "Equal" and "Urban" will be operating.	0.8039199084828251
The important thing is that we are consistent, and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner.	1.1794958279936345
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.7726130372920822
In all matters, we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision-making procedures involved in EU cooperation, for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control.	1.0642166626155933
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage, namely that we won't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted.	0.8744895576567555
I think that your proposal, Madam President, to keep the debate and the vote separate, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date, is a reasonable one.	1.0797590677644822
I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy.	1.1843472872046246

If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked, we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them.	0.780378439588845
Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production.	0.8656046866449955
Madam President, I had a major problem with this resolution.	1.087476312181786
I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other.	0.9080303032586019
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy.	1.0173748609382753
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned, I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, which means, in our view, that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER.	1.2515038785843486
I have rejected the entire directive, not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5/4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House.	0.9369686443188903

I would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal better than he has done; I would just like to add one small point: in addition to adaptation to ESA 95, there are two small technical changes which Mr Knörr knows all about, relating to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency.	0.7295257778185269
Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it.	1.0207931702995046
Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same. There will probably be differences of opinion, that would be only normal.	1.1985596347338985

Since 1995, following a concerted international effort between the main donor states, involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD' s Development Assistance Committee, it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies, both at national and international level.	1.0063937098945517

Mr President, Commissioners, I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG, but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas.	0.8849656476211252

I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.	0.8984297010020167

Nevertheless, I have said that I understand the arguments that people have been putting forward here and the Commission will endeavour to take account of these aspirations, but since this is all about Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective, we will not be able to do this without amending this Financial Perspective.	1.3588949808980606

Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think, in general, that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations, as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects.	1.0626690760053001

The amendments can be summarised as follows: they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence, introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible, and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications, an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various Member States of the Union.	0.8675395634368703

One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe.	1.0979582954864697

However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it.	0.8960649528610429
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring, on the one hand, that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that, on the other hand, there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses.	1.0122747538857257

The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.	0.8990936180155823

I am glad to see that the Commission and Parliament are converging towards the same goal in this area.	1.1066318033106861
In the period leading up to this, it already appeared, on the basis of the initial drafts, that the Commission had made very important pledges.	1.0027546741816507
Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.	0.9361516589670603
So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy' matters which we need to go into.	0.9236741887568668

We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind.

I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women.	1.0367474685201667
If not, will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?	1.1881746899024115

It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens, but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable, international environment, in which the goal of human safety is pursued.	1.2624759216418568
Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which, nonetheless, concludes that, as a Community, our accession to these two WIPO treaties must not boil down to a mere institutional development, however important that may be, i.e. the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together.	1.165861482884052
With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.	1.0881920727888548
Hardly surprising, would you not agree, Mrs Avilés Perea, not because we failed to find the necessary candidates, but because recent scientific research, instigated by the Commission, has shown that quotas are, in fact, only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats.	1.0165105771262053
Mr President, as far as the second reading is concerned, the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament.	1.106149144480559

Subject: Amount which Andalusia will receive from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period According to the Commission' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the Berlin Summit (which include per capita GDP, the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants), what amount is to be allocated to Andalusia from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period?	0.7419012937652149

The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others, as is written here, revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind, which some historians have described as the century of horrors; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider' s manifesto has stirred up once again, to our amazement.	0.8012097555118057

In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions.	0.9712519275204715

Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid.	1.0631748408178292
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them.	0.3716865057641322
As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, "In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"	0.8535088583078119
This report, therefore, appears at a crucial time, on the eve of Mr Kinnock' s reforms.	0.6590779565231419
But we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem.	0.9426804518617528
There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties.	1.0573654924247042
Relating to Wednesday:	0.11599930794535496
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation.	0.558973463789699
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.	0.46346892487356917
It is quite logical, it is consistent!	0.9360954032151636
I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.	0.7500253577768454
In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on.	1.450545719076874
As for us, we our bound by the terms of the texts: a maximum of four months.	0.9967721343479723
As I have understood it, there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood.	1.1149230447575742
In relation to China, we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked.	0.8163643830215177
Thirdly, unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time, tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes.	0.7447963874296086
Provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate, as an opportunity that each country should grasp, then this is the right approach.	1.052326200676077
I have two or three points to make in this respect.	1.0135103292061998
In some cases these operations were prepared well in advance, fully involving workers' representatives, with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions.	0.8381131922047663
Mr President, LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy, both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries.	1.1634012359526424
So, once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability.	0.9164671680435404
Secondly, we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes, and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation.	1.1795057214656735
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament' s opinion is.	1.158542292083758
I think we should reinstate this budget line.	0.7654324825266554
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures.	0.718792925270944
Mr President, I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report.	0.744023436523926
After all, there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor, rather, for legal reasons it has now become an independent, European authority, or "body" to quote Mrs Theato.	1.0632417511545298
This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice.	1.1143239549234478
I hope that, at the end of the debate, when all the speakers have contributed, I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments.	1.16121467817661
When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end.	0.8735707351351947
We must not be afraid to go forward, to react to changes in the market.	1.0815847884914673
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6716332755101017
There is no freedom without rules.	0.7127486358786495
Members, who, in the course of this debate, have properly praised Commission officials, who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity, hard-working and of great capability, are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.	1.01661301485113
Since then, expectations have been high.	0.5786318278801439
A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them, helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights.	0.8057789338769861
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.	1.0867408607240183
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow' s vote.	0.8203180841202472
UCITS	-0.0
However, I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that, as far as I am concerned, this partnership - and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool, one used to involve local brainpower, be it in the public sector, in the form of elected representatives, the social and educational sectors, associations, or in the private sector; a decentralised partnership, and let me mention in this connection, in response to Mrs Angelilli, the territorial pacts, which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.	1.230533556330981
Secondly, the European Union stands to gain, in my view, by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the Helsinki European Council.	0.9581582278282839
Just what is an army in the absence of a home country, in the absence of territory - because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests, which the Fifteen have, for good reason, never dared to discuss.	0.8906559414222253
We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described.	1.0864586417504312
It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million.	0.8207255230285728
And by way of reaffirming this once again, I have introduced an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members - and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow.	1.0132231380770538
The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines.	1.1117691846983324
But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.	0.8689725186285394
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work.	0.9257919750022594
These are: to make the systems employment-friendly; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term; to promote social integration; and to guarantee sustainable, high-quality health and medical care.	1.087173194895591
As a result, the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task.	1.0650997257617918
Mr President, the European Union environmental programme, to which a considerable amount (EUR 613 million) has been allocated, gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds.	1.111259890561115

It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective.	0.7862014752915895
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built.	0.9426465665835613
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union.	0.8099097926457609
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!	1.1372750827723717
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.	0.4501295876009938
Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets.	0.8832703963576523
We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union' s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.	0.9985348468823741
We can, and must, take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century, a century which is globalising fast.	0.820485926698241
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.	1.0697188597372431
Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government.	1.0233947778028047
If national governments had in their hearts - as the European Union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life, the pensions time bomb would already have been defused.	0.9145825473174165
A declared belief in human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an honest reappraisal of Austria' s role in the past, in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century, the holocaust, will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ.	0.9661494304617764
Last year, Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four, and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe, as they, in fact, should be, according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit.	0.8647201546342218
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.	1.0237643411571622
This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office.	0.6393047045472261
One of the EU' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market.	0.926253086117144
The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose.	0.7475203313930723
It is good that spending has become focused, as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds.	0.7288005271465622
Furthermore, it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament.	0.8599593352113278
The Commission' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.	0.91052970625174
We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year.	0.9676789481907293
In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself.	0.8973903902899274
The countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the European Union that guarantee better social protection.	0.71070881496202

Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, five months after its coming into office, the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union.	0.980339123266256
Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights.	0.7567702867903457
I hope that Parliament's participation in the Geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence. First and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects I have just mentioned as central to the identity of the European Union and of the European nation, and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place.	0.9662442554817631
Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it.	1.15484539957392
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations.	0.7277423104705132
The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe.	0.9299140376201447

What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission's work?	1.0264930587437895
In conclusion, since I do not think I need to say much, given the unanimity that exists here, I just want to make one brief remark to the President-in-Office. I think that there are some peculiarities in his position.	1.1869232622455081
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.	0.756119921805215

This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue.	0.6171246967600423
It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process.	0.9009634787727816
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.	1.1201297291281782
I am glad to see that Parliament' s amendments have focused upon this.	0.7793871521165422
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	1.0890705586683953
Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola.	0.8998941500766595
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.	1.0948598005725563
Experience in other sectors show a sort of U-curve pattern: a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place, as, of course, the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive; then a second phase of steady employment, as new jobs in newcomer operators balance further potential employment reductions; finally, a third phase of net job creation, both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly.	0.805035961464146
That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group, Mr Poettering, in his opening address.	1.0778880235621586
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments.	0.2868727988227943
We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries.	1.1036143187601475
The following amendments cannot be approved: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106 and 107.	0.43424017063836456
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly.	0.7100460733618976
It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties.	1.0839872157806667
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time.	1.0774408049020483
We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion. The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it.	1.0329502366816474
The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed, and in the correct category, so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned.	0.9498212648657286
May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.	0.8040944294240271
This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and, where necessary, confronting these is seriously limiting the will, duly confirmed by Mr Prodi, to grant public demands.	0.9046079694301756
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne' s reply.	0.8557630162200575
This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions. It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains, for example.	1.135214253464237
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee.	0.8386709851528112

If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.	0.9444741834455634

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster.	0.7990814348488035

For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.	0.9624713376587468

Of course, the situation was not idyllic, even before the bombardments, anything but, I should say. However, since NATO' s intervention, there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment.	1.1470520321545652
Mr President, this Parliament is fragmented and divided.	1.0214901780785803
You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere.	0.9332767817242262
This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy, but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance, trade and investment. Furthermore, this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries' own policies.	0.8616016169305144
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures, especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment.	0.749871870003057
She ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council, who is not exactly a stranger to you, how this presumed lack of coherence has come about.	0.716177238494218
It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.	1.0485100265177214
This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out.	0.6557199656035371
We trusted this Commission, from the outset, to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women.	0.8474324023643194
How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes?	0.6553799254151164
However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union.	0.898854696336032
Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended.	0.9986529741089262
Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect.	0.972763297656439
So this issue will be addressed.	0.7351472195250762
And we hope, during the Portuguese Presidency, to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned.	0.9890553895624741
As far as French planning experts are concerned, for example, the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.	0.7666058568883702
In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas.	1.0339168387236652
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis.	0.9351599420322392
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth: the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity, innovation enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens.	0.8450440113223704
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that, each time we make this type of decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.	0.8978967693004389
In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will appear possible.	1.031702451937158
Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern?	0.559504513821299
In this respect, the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed.	0.9066197113974203
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters.	1.0498689571717712
So this is what we are going to do.	0.9676226477610043
Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate.	0.6865783511849273
Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children.	1.0492862967881584
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard' .	0.4621178000986747
But I have a quite different question for the Council.	1.1066391143931242
Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection, which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe.	1.1920924649566538
The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial.	0.9215314362825283
He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health.	0.3933573380129671
We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports.	0.8307391910422189
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile.	1.0001623154225707
Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.	1.0432459723509924
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.	0.5206194799996764
If these amendments are adopted, I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues.	1.0021451242553403
That is what I would have preferred, personally.	1.3014396301041204
We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union.	0.8244957091320594
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.	0.8264401259300096
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too.	0.4196339433372863
We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet.	0.628959920920869
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction.	0.9736032742538142
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development?	0.7747044449793151
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary.	1.062433731624463
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.	0.5323225050109849
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date, or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level.	0.7072604410604435
Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe.	0.6821222747864707
These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel.	0.6638554778307637
In these circumstances, it is quite reasonable for this House to express concern today, asking an oral question which urges the Commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen.	0.7830273938019692
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions.	0.7265436663227066
The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers.	0.8119003117592541
Lastly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which, if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised, can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area, preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies.	1.0244497935679342
The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.	0.9687194933844265
It is, of course, only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry.	1.0008515699007385
Apart from that, the Tampere European Council has already indicated in which direction we, in the Commission, should go.	1.08263825462852
After years of 'good and loyal service' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries.	1.001779346976118
Madam President, my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.	0.8679708537910616
In a wider context, the priorities, as I see it, are to convert poor countries' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development, as well as control of fraud and corruption.	0.8864415270806953
The Socialists, like the Commission, question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract.	0.6838275294817387
Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation.	1.016664760084897
Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs, we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face, particularly in the area of external relations.	0.8350111848864836
However, agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues, and the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, has suggested three new topics: sovereignty, confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island.	0.953880670746869
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax.	0.8412488660000956
The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment.	1.0080603827886514
That is all I have to say for the moment.	1.1559698886663294
I would also like to say that the European Parliament' s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent European Union positions on various different issues, and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented.	1.0513605101447674
Mr President, the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament, it is not a personal statement.	1.243904109483398
Directive 70/524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives.	0.419601858427728
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC.	1.046793522704445
Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future.	0.46715324711229883
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful.	0.7487758499741775
RINA is currently the talk of the town.	0.6308934947895941
This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty.	1.1263989529973935
For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men.	0.888599134795262
If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.	0.9587147959338851
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.	1.0951775589265829
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement.	0.8740633970790094
.	-0.0
In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.	0.950036274652956
Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy.	0.9801288633837961
Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society.	0.9982913138041832
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament.	0.8157851150559849
This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated.	0.8309021780987424
For example, there are currently companies which set up in Holland because the postal charges are lower than in Germany and the same may happen in the future.	0.7277098642598007
What is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control.	0.6833246918591258
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available.	0.7626456394500835
We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market.	0.8360265949658222
A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough: we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors, for example.	0.9252741071852936
It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here.	0.9604943245153608
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years.	0.6334743632534425
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive.	0.7010908496993997
Through cooperation, small, independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains.	0.8723665351902274
In my country - I live in the north of Spain -, there is a considerable difference between the north and the south, and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another.	0.9945509596613894
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable?	0.7519914063777258
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000.	1.011786645585469
I feel that this behaviour, particularly in your presence, is unacceptable and totally repugnant, especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign.	1.1634162271002206
Will you please therefore undertake, before the next plenary in February, to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public, immediately the Council has passed legislation, rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list.	0.9060177986244992
(Applause)	-0.0
Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly.	0.7081593311689921
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced.	0.7877069053304571
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain.	0.8808445854333586
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because, as you know, it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed.	0.991852354588215
Firstly, we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council.	1.0564572391765628
What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere.	1.023662602925834
Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999.	1.3046394949516673
All those things come together.	0.42124272419927455
This applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide.	0.36362006577106437
We need to continue to stand up for these rights, especially in our own Member States and societies, but also elsewhere.	1.2199332617629939
For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur.	0.8464650609940562
Another issue, which is somewhat problematic, is that of intermediate storage.	1.1495973176006378
Most say it is about time.	0.6399730514524483
I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments.	1.0709194483389903
We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard.	0.6664071995341054
Some of these differences have already been ironed out, but others persist.	1.0187827254100692
The Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions, which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand.	0.8833114341533602
We live in a world of rules and regulations: let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future.	0.8491175684942283
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way.	0.7996626308231087
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly.	0.8348945290476785
Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate.	1.0951981066017982
The decision to include a clause obliging ACP countries to take back illegal immigrants entering Europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity.	0.8658102377688993
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.	0.7889282005490311
However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment.	0.9649204338685619
This is also at the request of the citizens.	1.046896271897292
Report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/2000 - 1999/0240(CNS))	0.6146424345680185
All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions.	0.8802684810694699
This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial, because it serves as a model.	1.0519608408617798
Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers!	0.33831347256087835
It was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and, obviously in vain, offered the Freedom Party ministerial posts, that the SPÖ begin its massive campaign against Haider.	0.7452946421388591
Report (A5-0073/1999) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code) (COM(1999)94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS))	0.5511256058219376
All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims.	0.7557849533444627
The proposals in Mrs Theato' s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection, under criminal law, of our financial interests, which would criminalise certain activity, specifically fraud against the Community budget. These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community.	1.0893709158903744
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.	1.019546317473309
Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons, particularly Flora Brovina, a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met, together with the Women in Black of Belgrade, during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups.	0.8197829246077735
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations.	0.8556669215745896
Our responsibility as members of the European Parliament is to ensure that the process of enlargement takes place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that, when the time comes, the citizens of the European Union and the citizens of the Czech Republic will approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union through their elected representatives.	0.9650061594874036
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe.	0.7642265424986541
First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails.	0.9147235029100371
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?	0.8995374220567692
I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job, but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent, partly by including it among its strategic goals.	0.9638177025575386
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes.	0.7347270938425571
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.	1.1688526534015733
It must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget.	0.6942796035853391
We can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originates from inside or outside the Community. This is why we have proposed the creation of a European public prosecutor who could, having investigated a case from start to finish, then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court.	0.7968045483368759
Here too, the structure of the economy differs for each Member State, and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse.	1.072295842734531
Nonetheless, the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have diverted the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations.	0.9602568778994259
We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter.	0.8832739491058519
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes?	0.8704769043582725
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment, in order to promote employment.	0.9106081592423518
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.	1.0336875964173
. I welcome this proposal to protect the Euro against forgers.	1.3422277644234926
This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does?	0.7545458114191739
There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve.	1.0501307699182028
Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines.	1.141081748200487
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty.	0.9792418151609266
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.	0.647386948565763
I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday.	0.9101255649747284
I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter.	1.043887554326791
Europe is its people, its history and now its collectivity; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this: I will wager that when we ask the question - 'What is Europe?' - we answer it by saying, 'It is our art, it is our literature and it is our heritage.'	1.0222874863375044
- (SV) In order to be able to influence developments, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution, which displays far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999.	1.0398273540583165
Today, nobody can ignore the fact that new digital technologies and systems, with Internet at the sharp end, mobile telephones and digital television, are bringing about radical changes in tourism as a whole and its respective structures and operational models.	0.9025692114999608
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement.	0.924491300179753
Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process.	0.5742932283985226
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own.	0.6487049353908273
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.	0.880626135662806
For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated.	0.6290915206372818
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution, but against the granting of discharge.	0.9598273233140637
To date, the Member States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the criteria laid down in ESA 79.	0.7472016430024361
According to the Commission' s proposal -20ºC would have been sufficient. On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.	0.8452635235091304
In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.	0.9720418110900746
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but, nonetheless, the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward.	1.0686360122139407
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability.	1.008769055987095
By lowering the price/weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising mailshots or cross-border post, the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector.	0.7745011101695471
For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes.	0.8621834474987592
That too is feasible.	0.38759443447447484
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice.	1.01344292910295
Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government.	0.9108511346291193
I have taken note of your comment, Mr Speroni.	0.9124503846749819
I should like to hope that such an appeal from Europe, with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement, would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the Skopje government, so that it can respond appropriately, on the one hand, to Greece' s demonstrably conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue, and, on the other hand, to the more general practical, declared intention and disposition of all the partners in the European Union, including Greece, to facilitate and support FYROM' s progress towards a United Europe.	0.8951039560558598
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter.	0.7781081998894822
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	0.7448137841651069
The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community' s action is, as you know, one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation.	1.0515932928157603
What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	0.50209697517904
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed.	0.9907513046364463
Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.	0.8786400316161644
Unfortunately, his text has not survived the vote.	0.6585146204409676
I have received 7 motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2), to close the present statement.	0.8338971854900085
Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service.	0.6092647213820629
On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point.	0.984027403895112
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration' , as others too have said here.	0.9982908338122268
I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility.	0.773522423737284
By definition, investment funds use other people' s money.	0.6583728624056719
They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas.	0.41095754663239914
In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity.	0.6829817204551472
I will not talk about codecision here, but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important.	1.1639051786500554
You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard.	1.0763856468412627
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.	0.7923127711023946
Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons.	1.017659204856157
Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive.	0.7522609010269091
In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of, at Sintra, the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is 'pretentiously' called autonomous.	0.6631221689936341
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.	0.9209171572622086
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now.	0.6026294881017699
It is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a 'public service' , which makes it possible for everyone resident within European territory to receive the service, and this entitlement must remain an acquired right, an acquis communautaire.	0.944123580479962
These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy.	0.409838115393423
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my maiden speech and I am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights.	0.8573769628005916
This is a creative initiative, which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics, but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue.	1.1252916735550245
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment.	1.097445562687336
Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money" indicators in the grant-giving process.	0.9320013075939015
Nevertheless, to avoid the customary circus, which every six months has us indiscriminately attacking the Presidency of the Council, maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years.	0.7936515832576855
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget.	0.7292336076695244
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council.	0.8019949939465594
In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most.	0.9322009562028952
I might never have studied otherwise.	0.3008571153896115
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.	0.8899622965529687
In the world of networking, the mail service is the most democratic of all networks.	0.9788702744445336
Within these regions, a huge range of problems have their part to play.	0.9271343114668402
In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day.	0.9773216981846686
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign.	1.2919267893348072
Based on a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials.	0.8919637121868415
There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes.	0.578734032003807
It is not enough that all the world' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme, as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries.	0.9500693590901443
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.	0.5093111907863522
We stand ready to do so.	0.3754446110070374
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared.	0.7309056564740123
Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation, having access to EQUAL, I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees.	0.8657809825313195
We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media.	0.7808490504242513
Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said.	1.0187679141850614
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue.	0.7469052029814982
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything.	0.4731916181968444
Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere.	0.6629702977062764
Mr President, in relation to the Schroedter report, I am aware, and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier, that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland.	0.9518797220969334
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present, I think.	1.062982388001188
Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women?	0.9773582691394741
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.	0.5784064173083714
Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola.	0.9291647966973474
We can therefore welcome its adoption.	0.5075810562190302
And these are the consequences!	0.8035485359465434
I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO.	0.9326553046416727
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years' time!	0.7919154521797401
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made.	1.0016003885062985
That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen, an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms, with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection, in other words, a Union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies.	0.995645576364349
. I regret to say that I believe that the thought-out position I advanced yesterday is the correct position.	0.9538079382317457
The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system.	0.9352505123323404
In this case, which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers, you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk.	0.8008822661990448
We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country's needs, but also of its policy performance.	0.9893847367579487
It specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG, PHARE, Sapard or MEDA.	0.4238026203676796
Indeed, this is one advantage of the present system.	1.2712867584404173
However, saying is one thing and doing is another!	0.8075733503680612
It sets environmental parameters close to zero.	0.4756404677512879
The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road.	0.43662340320519305
Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency, and that country would be accountable, both morally and economically, if its actions were to contribute to a delay.	1.026983165306952
I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé.	0.6965270767281394
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.	0.43393274416915595
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.	0.8818068056122705
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics.	0.6655314876812393
In these cases, Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position.	0.9417518234750579
I am using the phrase 'is said to be' on purpose, because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war.	0.6889007021007216
In this sense, the Commission must insist, and I should like to endorse and confirm this here, that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding, enforceable rights.	1.100961667052729
I think, therefore, that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects, and as far as I know, this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination.	1.1854104413862598
Mr Böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee, and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him: he is the one with the experience.	0.8633618981082148
The international community is sending conflicting messages to this country.	0.5703045117189696
It is not by chance that, immediately after Helsinki, the Turkish Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, stated that the Cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974.	0.8043226199124457
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your reply, although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet, since this matter is of the greatest importance.	1.160410954475932
I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.	1.0395859581877358
Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural.	1.1082791792010587
Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.	1.2245079200307003
Therefore, will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article 7.1 that there is 'the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.1.' , and urge the Council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to Austria including the voting rights of the representative of Austria in the Council?	0.8505024558235704
We must be very vigilant.	0.9890175330738141
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.	0.7099892384716968
And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side.	1.0566303923974922
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said.	0.9948017656253084
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States.	0.5234330200791272
Many thanks for this.	0.25535039911303237
I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together.	1.08342157182717
I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes.	0.9289864750211155
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.	0.9049350562776602
Madam President, I want to express my concern that this clear defence by Mr Knörr Borràs of human rights apparently does not prevent his government from cooperating in Parliament with a political group which not only does not condemn, but collaborates with and encourages, violence against people and property.	0.8740277185271859
After all, innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without European funding.	0.6843085880042818
I do not think so.	0.722351867313937
I want to thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that, as we enter the new millennium, you have an especially important role.	1.3003683102258892
Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution, that is, it must not entail more risks.	1.0083790980351814
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting, when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on.	0.9978251430975641
This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu.	0.8366936045693398
This is all I can say today.	0.9589775263341671
They see us restricting each other's liberties.	0.4342106170411721
We will need the European Public Prosecutor' s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects.	1.17605971564844
I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal.	1.108409189941004
This is, and will continue to be, connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation.	0.8062657517513105
This is where we want to go.	1.035609615696306
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are.	0.7497256640457008
It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment.	0.9739991429589274
Mr President, it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.	0.8804658942905622
I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.	1.013058648088672
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry.	0.9475187573491404
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and, based on very strict evaluations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively.	0.7630308001248715
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development, whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself, and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes, included in Objectives 1 and 2, and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located.	0.9900160235951059
It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way.	0.8277187790798693
It could have sunk anywhere.	0.5526848163471871
Like a number of previous speakers, I, too, wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects, which, in my view, should be incorporated into the pubic domain.	1.018947255636413
It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993.	0.6017574297398626
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues.	0.7888298784870318
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs.	0.7269423906538188
It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime.	0.909490614935787
I believe that, despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island, these points, which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides, may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution.	1.0570236495981606
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy. Time and time again, good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented.	0.9075380880010528
It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection!	1.105107379689814
Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.	1.0898375506432803
The Commission sympathises with these considerations.	0.34880382347244304
The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better.	0.5870155615325037
Mr Alavanos, I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised.	0.9356917745770986
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention.	0.6977682962395176
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.	0.7664672616172747
Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.	1.0225678470582995
Let me give you three examples.	0.46202100486378417
Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation.	0.984237783666808
It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened.	0.7841462186787581
For example, if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of, the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe, very hard-pressed, a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine, seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States.	0.8279258796927759
The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes.	0.7732173189488648
During the Portuguese Presidency, we will be continuing discussions on the CAP, by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers' incomes, paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms.	0.9191282334386494
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.	0.7661598001826863
First, by promoting a trend towards regional meetings of the Joint Assembly, as recommended in the Corrie report, thereby enabling working methods to be adapted to the new types of cooperation envisaged (regional economic partnership agreements).	0.9603955646196176
Under those conditions, then, there has been a real failure.	0.9992202373091098
For all these reasons, I think that reforming the Treaties would allow the huge tourist question, which is an important asset for the whole planet, to be properly integrated.	1.2283140275032944
It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred, but it is important for the sake of Kosovo, the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail.	1.085845626397365
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU.	0.6960973355966609
Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September.	0.9532176507524035
In view of this unusual situation, will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises?	0.9816410818940124
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way.	0.9485397271462008
My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand.	0.9114401351859135
We are a group of unity in diversity.	0.5964288145943074
Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur' s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire.	0.7871664690446838
The cultural programmes launched in years past - Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael - are being replaced by a single programme, Culture 2000, where - and I must stress this here very forcefully - the rapporteur censures a position which should give the European Parliament cause for reflection - as someone said this afternoon - but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor.	1.015974227512368
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months.	0.7068514797889754
However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.	1.0255733794005726
Before the final vote:	0.6504021127552428
During Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking "that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted."	0.7550452207623431
Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union.	0.9324324675273613
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car.	0.9709260557161044
I know many have already done so, but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides, and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.	0.9595896824576874
Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for.	0.8713860243814883
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.	0.879867032192018
In our view, the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to update the definitions and the assessments of some of the economic operations involved in the calculation of deficits, as reflected in the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Treaty of Maastricht, which lays down the maximum percentages which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of GDP at market prices in the various Member States.	1.0275268554797834
We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament.	1.0443828863683733
Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed.	1.2094690205840184
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme.	0.8097596695332715
In the case of a non-Schengen state, in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22, that possibility is contemplated, and is perfectly expressed, and I believe this provides greater legal security.	1.1402504046965873
Coordination of Community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies, transport, employment, environment, culture and competition must strongly involve Member States and the tourism industry itself.	0.7456804751986815
We believe that the universal service is a pillar and I am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee.	0.921425853287619
The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible.	0.8230979802123906
The Council's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas.	0.7035910388507598
I also reject this line of argument.	0.53427833144128
After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour.	0.822477504202225
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now.	0.8021845298233095
These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002.	0.6410256833079984
Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group.	0.8244619165073012
Not a single piece of information, nor a single consultation, has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom, nor on the incorporation of Greece, nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland.	0.8936360893255053
They should be accessible to smaller groups, accessible for them to be able to devise, implement and monitor the programmes.	0.7113144923645274
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset.	0.757787936206345
In the past, the Commission had requested quantitative records of the losses incurred by companies because of such bankruptcies, so that it could form an opinion, and asked the European confederations of hotel-and-restaurant owners and tourist agencies, HOTREC and ECTAA, to work out and draw up a regulation to govern the relations between them.	0.816847497934852
Man and culture are priorities, and culture can result in economic growth.	0.7979934647048512
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.	1.1103553842521088
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was, after all, in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO.	0.7880617979008111
Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception, and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at.	1.2198191029879537
What now needs to be done, and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government, and with other governments, is to find the best way forward, so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States, and which constitutes a general framework, can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries.	1.0924672763197354
It is not its job to subrogate to people in their choices or, failing that, reinvent a new variation on a 'sense of history' which perceives self-determination as a one-way street.	0.7129453591246714
OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud.	1.0184167957205366
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war.	0.3971705503555729
Mr President, I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP.	1.2004874501816527
Today, we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech.	0.8342696005644418
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority.	0.992957401417587
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority.	1.13291916871068
These are serious matters on which this House must act.	0.7258672610713284
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.	0.9315311462989306
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria.	1.222153811463295
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself.	1.0349937622886267
Since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups.	0.7270343554072034
We note, first of all, that the committee considers the data, as presented in the Commission' s annual report, to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate, sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition, pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.	0.9263555978036006
Having said this, the EU' s responsibility, which is both yours and ours, is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region.	1.0374214510041266
Just three months ago I took the floor in this House to congratulate the Irish and British people on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland settlement, as many other colleagues did.	0.987934873716109
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States.	0.8987409887783637
For our part, we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which, far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency, imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket, which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe.	0.8371931306701244
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area.	0.8792359294622577
They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees.	0.6697900337097157
It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources.	0.8245128323636342
People will remember that this article, dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level, stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system.	0.9410404773336531
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents, made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten's report.	0.7458649403254897
Ladies and gentlemen, none of us must forget what has taken place.	0.5939126604469014
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation.	0.9465187098540402
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.	0.9865428063062223
I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue.	0.6951950589007675
When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known.	0.6075523957440426
Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.	1.0318761694776641
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument.	0.8827121584277005
Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wonders if the idea of foisting unified management rules on the postal services of the fifteen Member States might not be, essentially, flawed.	0.8733158018314158
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks, if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºC. This is in the special interest of northern European regions.	1.0829279894524086
We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans.	0.8742041696355982
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets.	0.6797749566701976
Provide the Commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States, and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at Tampere and move towards a Union which is freer, more just and more secure.	1.0464459256940233
We are talking about macrofinancial aid.	0.3059499905960572
The next item is the report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS))	0.5376675348435352
In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life.	1.0702282162949788
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction.	0.971490030294323
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word "qualifications" also crops up.	0.6647650447003396
If we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations, because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself, only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint.	0.9312281107932567
Your President, Mrs Fontaine, has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue. I can assure you that, whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue, the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament.	1.0767596970815292
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view.	1.0171503681180925
I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report.	0.8622504257865639
The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs.	1.1014099866146039
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.	0.8208476182380865
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment.	1.3384939027535507
At a time when the Joint Assembly is opening its doors ever wider to the elected representatives from parliaments in the ACP, this dimension must not only be preserved; above all, it must be encouraged.	0.9040888487681694
It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States.	1.026957537122461
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.724084340226242
. (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament' s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III.	1.0150029320131897
I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation.	1.0120124588405093
Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public.	0.8190229960694565
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed.	0.9860374700471647
Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration, with particular reference to the rights of women and children.	0.9318856272282273
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been.	0.9492253497036952
Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy.	0.8613971900896991
The market favours the short term and immediate profits.	0.41315818006506283
Madam President, whoever has the honour, like myself, to chair the Committee on Culture, cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur, and Commissioner Reding, with whom he worked and who, even during the conciliation process, had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone.	1.1172600049317996
Indeed that was the idea behind it.	0.6944039856541516
However, in the future, the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market.	1.0269050435052327
Mr President, it is very likely that, during this century, good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil.	0.9541737143648978
On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously.	1.0088217710391796
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.	1.1462024650947051
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo.	0.9084237699869424
Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.	0.8848986970732564
I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy?	0.9463035660971347
I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.	1.1427819491146636
Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation.	0.7627169572692332
Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives.	0.6244322653932779
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care, on support to institutions as well as vaccination.	0.6971613712675475
The Labour Government' s record in Britain is also a proud one.	0.5790372974951495
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process.	0.5981744146612346
Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control.	0.6913099371231741
However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation.	0.8695517690742322
As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector.	0.9242716469795563
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew.	0.6461206833507948
So how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed, impoverished and marginalised people, the 'working poor' of part-time employment, and working conditions that are dissociated from the policies implemented?	0.8872797324761482
Therefore, subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting, I can confirm what you have just said, that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort.	1.0120669122535846
First and foremost, we need to compete in terms of quality.	0.736989940215871
Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them.	0.7807648085792859
Also, our presence on the ground: basically, I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves, we are seen as a neutral, welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be.	0.9530881835398384
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue.	1.0766069435882215
Two questions if I may.	0.5429521282660897
Use of ICT opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism.	0.7552530395853201
Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts.	0.9308679506255911
For my group, enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured, be they governance, be they the intergovernmental conference, be they reform of the institutions.	1.0210768187244013
We think there are other positive advances too.	0.6661967293622121
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation.	0.9348969700776546
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?	0.36509436150603086
To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and, by realigning old procedures with the new situation, we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past.	0.9884303069232759
I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity.	0.777119650940636
That shows that competition really is working.	0.35556154844164267
I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument, which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.	1.0477271106117554
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye.	0.35877002564110544
For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.	0.7163790124067847
I respect your understanding and knowledge of the Balkan region, Mr Alyssandrakis, but I find it difficult, quite frankly, to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can, in terms of political stability, be a solution to the problem.	1.200106714421299
It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament.	1.0129029762913695
Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum.	0.20018455203721916
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative.	0.7687214650477807
They even reject the strict minimum, i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels.	0.9745226411543818
Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.	1.2279862108760107
However, I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation.	1.1057775369997214
I also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in, as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 November last year and then on 26 January. I further regret the fact that neither the regions, nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme.	0.8448112816691294
In contrast to how things are done here in the European Parliament and in Parliament' s committees, where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports, there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves.	0.9392527416528509
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000?	0.7574411094417921
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile.	0.9412777656639498
In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.	0.5451481468331778
The report shows that, in general, they are a long way behind EU countries, especially in terms of GDP per capita.	0.9899789995466056
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms.	0.5411482281462204
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.	0.4217736366617903
The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough.	1.0408906189463019
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds.	0.9510056407211678
I visited Doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture, fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised.	0.6583435883487984
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements.	0.9314080374785982
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.	0.7534175480747609
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue.	1.0187841057023677
I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange.	1.2360596724067605
We already have legislation.	0.6146197123147743
I shall therefore reiterate that, as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly, LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union' s policy on the environment.	1.0763010802599557
It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal.	0.6901121210684633
The market is a law unto itself.	0.57917269665477
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	0.7199183958698782
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.	0.8358787767803171
We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect.	0.9073836278001215
Subsistence farming is not based on price calculations, it is based on the hope of rain in the next season.	0.8426478954853056
In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended.	1.1035615733996043
The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid.	0.562119819927275
Question No 12 by (H-0801/99):	0.396625633154711
Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive.	0.9133106540197481
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220.	0.9789637214767173
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak, inappropriately in your case, as a maiden speech.	0.8107502398642115
First, the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by 'government institutional sector' under ESA 95.	0.7944317193416125
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good.	0.7122123319177868
Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced.	1.1325929324266548
One or two honourable Members, Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan, spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality.	0.7007025866815502
We have taken note of this.	0.6943995192360146
We will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement, to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies, and, as regards development in particular, to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective.	1.0491032385038583
Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe.	0.9743506960760681
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases.	0.9228137874380079
And here I want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition.	1.2459374387311302
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	0.8388806157755628
During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that, in respect of least-developed, landlocked and island states, assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2% loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10% for the other ACP states.	0.8407577560771233
The real culprits are Austria' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.	0.5366890665733676
Good governance criteria broadly covering questions of refugees, corruption, human rights and democracy will be part of the finalised accord between the European Union and all countries signing the Lomé Convention from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region.	0.8571225541017653
This is something that the EU can rightly be proud of, and I think we should shout it from the rooftops more often.	1.1852964792765905
This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction.	0.6932452515327705
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced.	1.0852165096170545
The debate is closed.	0.0956786056282443
I listened to your general guidelines and I would like to ask you what is the position of children, as entities in their own right, in the Commission' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty-first century.	0.9961015347789568
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment.	0.6854592387007582
This is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in, making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs, and noting that the latter "shall be authorised only if ... safe for human health and the environment" .	0.8713832314831279
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper.	0.6532663816802012
With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period.	0.9329265751383179
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible.	0.9227154441085845
The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free.	0.6076809108743876
Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases.	0.9667961744654141
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices.	0.7849185896266074
You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations.	1.2178342073028847
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Senate.	0.907562285398797
But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany.	0.7374125160508841
Mr President, Commissioner, the new attitude adopted recently by the Commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who, in recent years, have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the Community framework.	1.1500176583184059
I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities.	0.5436510085667213
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.	0.4691161733822767
The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.	0.7293799017551053
Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself.	1.0142141173448747
Finally, I thank you again for this debate.	1.1998569226881455
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans.	1.0590780998720872
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use.	1.054357049461831
Unfortunately, a number of deadlines have been exceeded.	0.7615972830291668
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised.	0.5443261987256703
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate.	0.7870020318427868
We must therefore welcome the fact that the Helsinki European Council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions, and I quote, that "If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations, the Council' s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition" .	1.0456288985167383
The discretional power of the State, which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10, seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report.	0.8331304862410767
Yes, it does say: 'Coherence of different Union policies with development policy' .	0.9462502518227163
We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector.	0.8739342336755598
Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable.	0.8678154629971677
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dares to preach to us about the second world war, when it is international socialist in the way that its peers were National Socialists, still goose-stepping, the party of the Waffen SS...	0.8533639096966038
Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year, given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks?	0.5554083735839723
The present programme' s key measures - water quality, tomorrow' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions.	0.8577937596635616
At the same time, however, there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate, particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems, together with a need to focus special attention on these countries' own policies for reducing poverty.	0.8165421665049424
We are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or Europe.	0.5396635607875957
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur?	0.495180633209522
The content of my amendment is, in fact, echoed in Amendment No 43, which also stipulates this condition of accrual.	0.953789264989964
It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased.	0.7344211344849256
We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade, including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade.	0.6697267318094543
And indeed there is a twofold shift.	0.6515224154307794
That, too, is a step forward.	1.1414884933749188
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	0.5023590601370556
We must resolve this issue, because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat.	0.9935903703323199
We must start by going beyond man, who is not the master of the universe, to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values, without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and bloodshed.	0.9668264523321317
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken.	0.6797665509237253
In saying that, we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with, but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service.	1.0114117567835272
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times, a country that is, however, moving in a very promising direction, thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community.	0.9185846285903575
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals.	0.7731994991390989
While Commissioner Patten' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information.	0.7691112633181244
(Applause)	-0.0
This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.	1.0279206025878989
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component, namely refugees.	1.0723625393417224
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations.	0.45421032690481705
We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question.	1.0989623423813735
That is absolutely crucial.	0.7478767017219851
Another challenge is presented by technical development.	0.3946474420193564
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment.	0.7525474997619537
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words.	0.8456546458697228
The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry, port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law. Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent.	0.8333847967157326
A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point. If the Union is purely an economic union, then it is a stillborn project.	1.171133455954437
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area.	1.1418404318537034
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible.	0.39093913188654367
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].	0.6673757169404053
This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully.	1.1201470805698794
Let us just consider for a moment.	0.45401346043760316
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east Asian currencies in 1997.	0.7331909145862536
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it.	1.0789938327924955
Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers.	0.8166000290715738
My question, which the President-in-Office did not answer, is this: if this inquisition procedure begins, in which the main or, if you will, one of the main people interrogated and probably found guilty will be Mr Solana, who is today the High Representative of the European Union' s Common Foreign and Security Policy, should it not be, if that happens, if the General Prosecutor of the Tribunal is determined to begin the process, that Mr Solana' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean?	1.019390834133405
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.	1.0562656449508359
This programme, together with the SAVE II programme, integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy, establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence.	0.6466651372951863
In any event, I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today.	1.1289112946999982
There will be friendship, calm, openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process.	0.716236932892895
We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure.	1.0911249381269406
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000)	0.4615084710931266
Madam President, I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i's left for me to dot.	1.3187298414627113
With regard to policy, this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another.	0.6853806661479497
We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve.	1.0335457557862346
The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy!	1.1977322682099827
Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences.	0.5564104685423988
Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.	1.201767465322793
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.	0.984085740120233
So what are we to do now?	0.5441940445153269
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.	0.9331778502579711
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete.	0.7532655519838515
They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff.	0.7798438155983134
This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union.	1.0331444495365694
Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China.	0.8848094994003638
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry.	0.5117921540258223
Therefore, we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and, to this end, I ask that you support Amendment No 95, which has been presented by our group.	1.1155091691064944
However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process.	1.1396049881108328
Mr President, Commissioner, water is a precious natural asset, a vital necessity, and it is our duty to protect it.	1.0399012664792615
I come from Munich, a very densely populated urban conglomeration, but we have the same problem there.	1.2775587300426097
Article 3 of the Treaty states that, in all the activities referred to in this Article, the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between women and men.	1.2477457853108067
As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.	1.0005115948031384
Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act.	1.1498170074842964
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	0.8088251937773523
We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy, and the EAGGF, of course, has a crucial role to play in this.	1.1262293872489533
Today, we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel, who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represents Austria' s governing conservative party and its policy.	0.8986956053763693
For years certain countries, including Great Britain, have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens.	0.8456042111127867
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.	0.9837249578413348
Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be.	0.8196159115433669
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.	0.7944410454814799
The postal services in Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands or Belgium are, of course, all different.	0.8753268229198055
Trees have been uprooted, houses are still being demolished and, above all, water supplies have been reduced or refused, especially in East Jerusalem, while the settlements continue and are growing constantly.	0.6756447248102033
Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services.	1.1127642427639848
I would like to inform you that there is a delegation from Kuwait, led by His Excellency, Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah, Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister, here in the official gallery.	0.8020514118139902
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.	1.208910661706055
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action, in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations.	1.081964427695686
Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region.	0.9747662394378643
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.	0.9778497424819865
For us, the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years.	1.1651368987487165
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].	0.6682316684583869
Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants, which we have always considered to be a priority, and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader, Mr Barón Crespo, we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors.	1.1751684336410033
If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive.	1.0629948433256813
We would like to thank the President of the Republic, as well as the Government and all the politicians who spoke and we too, in this House, would also call on the German Chancellor not to intervene in Italian internal affairs.	1.0650713933102667
I do not want to minimise these, but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned, even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain.	0.9647332594726208
What else can we do to support this opposition?	0.840444643516672
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	0.5574655576672646
Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold.	0.8184626968883035
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year.	0.5348004234623246
We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life.	1.0161839282352234
I am therefore voting against the proposal.	0.8536520523815205
Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable.	0.7947435842118624
Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides.	0.6389331992259708
Macedonia' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries.	0.7589882405321353
From the data which I am referring to today, it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact.	0.7391232271295154
But what do these sanctions mean?	0.34972228668614463

Mr President, will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds?	0.7067361786912285
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.	0.8854212926270563
What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States' obligations are laid down in detail. There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation.	1.016050277428719
It has clear, ambitious objectives.	0.5532713510976263
Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening.	1.0426391411102058
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.	0.7026074835928937
It is my intention, as it has always been, to work in cooperation with Parliament, to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results.	1.3025509612280701
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this, but sometimes that is my job.	0.9862309424970326
The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased.	1.1232171217746272
Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company.	0.7785338762550302
We shall now proceed to the vote.1	0.6043536482143017
It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed.	1.0314976244208782

In the important debate on competition this morning, I expressed my views on Mr Langen' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	0.7251461973543346
The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency.	1.0007264540902423
The question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable.	0.9289424805998139
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group.	0.9365595603668536
Finally, you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians, or are allowing this to happen, just because the result does not suit you.	0.8168201593074521
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe.	0.9778983839050153
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver "EC service provision card" and not "EU service provision card" .	0.8753071835341204
Tell the truth for once. You could not care less what the people of Europe want.	0.8291576535556131
Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property.	0.8422123981050801
If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification?	1.1465390636051884
And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence.	0.769339818513009
I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen.	0.7468199316701649
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised.	0.4847726985210675
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate, in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half, I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time.	1.0509239914788095
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice?	0.8232838887423957
Never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries.	0.5106396700200064

We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone.	0.7565503819398816
Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.	1.1469637997386615
There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern.	1.1131234098436984
After the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants, the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States, this squandering will generate even more protest.	0.8725022110852524
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.	1.0295986254229939
Mr President, firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker" for the entire operation.	0.9710564795138924

Having made these general observations, I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG.	0.7560361608803348
Mr President, Commissioner, does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy?	0.7158063174514835
The smell is absolutely disgusting!	0.20069419787973528
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets, yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity.	0.5847792651255749
The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House.	0.9919874671380109

Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls.	0.8675088284174511
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms.	0.6634101118792612
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations.	0.4537910857498764
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.	0.9774635622533513
The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence.	1.1299882240582844
I do not have exact figures, but the Community' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller, to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office.	0.9794166894147994
Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.	0.9454502963578587
What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history, values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own?	0.6016122281806269
Firstly, this is welcome because it explains, to our fellow citizens, what we are intending to do and what we are already doing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future.	1.28930554715466
It is very helpful.	0.7596363205647482
First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report.	1.2298178242712516
The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.	0.8803650881332266
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible, both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned, in other words, we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000.	1.0220210010133277
It is essential to establish a single European system, but one based on fairness, full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions, including an end to routine detention.	1.1280372005036918
I want to be very candid: I have not seen much enthusiasm about that conference or the proposal to enlarge the powers of the EU.	1.1576730006244202

However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,	1.3863947624605926
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.	0.7620102784076469
All we find are vague phrases about 'strategic partnerships' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it.	0.7435208746691779
The Commission, in my opinion, has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated.	1.0249726000626886
That is all to the good.	0.7530200195449712

However, we, the Parliament and, in particular, the group of the Social Democrats, want Lisbon to go one step further now.	1.1766501510289067
A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject.	1.0594419487080133
What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and, significantly, the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture; we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens, who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances.	0.9719078725091462
In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.	0.748368035825608
He is a dangerous man.	0.7352354361319724
We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!	1.0484298044714906

In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role ... in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial.'	0.8762460367941728

As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which, I believe, Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him: I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant, and perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit.	1.0025986413247037

There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such, and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries.	1.2204707397171695
Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union.	1.0272377299161015
To my mind though, what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing, supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan.	0.7931519670994323
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission' s proposal on scrapie.	0.9675924813249113

Since time immemorial it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as Andalusians from day one, whether or not they were born in our region. Therefore, as an MEP, but primarily as an Andalusian, I can feel only sadness, repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community.	0.9006119910967636

At this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-Nazis in the government of a European Union Member State, I must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone.	1.0967551462314273
I would like to remind you, however, that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared, the fifth programme for equality between men and women.	1.0104084499877506
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it.	0.576336743072485

First of all, I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned.	1.095802814436668
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States.	1.076812350861491
I do not have these concerns.	0.922855319658591

In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.	0.9615569195978024

However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute.	0.7759532603408872
It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime.	1.0501470470831824
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level.	0.7926684606681877
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period.	0.44754646154175176
With sorrow, I stress that in the context of restructuring the Commission' s services, tourism is dealt with by a section, not even a directorate, within the Directorate-General for 'Enterprise' .	1.0204874449451125
The outcome can be considered reasonable, when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council.	1.0252844923173894
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus;	0.8734464145747458
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!	1.2745653650592876
But what have we seen since then?	0.2777966627508353
My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one.	1.1573856599801293
We must improve information on all of the world' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them.	1.1767223447457342
In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries.	1.032580395036582
Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples, hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment.	0.7636837544632606
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States.	0.8784824138932876
We can do this by, as a Parliament, amending the Council' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment.	1.070182375238592
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful, because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million.	0.8833389504739383
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9318633319175985
Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right.	0.8902706421317602
. (FR) The current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment, poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending.	0.800087367097027
This second option has won the day and I am pleased about this. However, in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the Council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive.	1.0944304163641105
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, in my view, this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses.	0.9458457831501429
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction.	1.0749189662662693
Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.	0.7253883824678276
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent, Tajikistan.	0.704667118907218
It has been said before, and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions, that culture is, of course, extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the European idea.	1.078008213655136
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments.	0.9759643003760339
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.	0.8467376852547981
Minister Gomes, I have, of course, heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency.	0.9663974374087841
Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy, for the first time, concerning such a difficult regulation?	0.9200475645772891
It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest.	0.9162173937816338
We take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time, but the Commission will not adopt this.	1.1553441859041642
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session.	0.7320807270587197
At the same time, it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings, particularly those we are concerned with today.	0.9693975951041923
Here, in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the Pre-Accession Pact, it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the European Union and the Russian Federation, a plan which is now being finalised, and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the Member States, in Moscow, and to develop a set of further initiatives.	1.16262299539224
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings.	1.1854754659632276
We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production.	0.946772292969479
The text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set-ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties respectively.	0.6468105964549741
Other important areas are, of course, the flow of private investments, cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with, and finances solutions to, a variety of global problems which affect us all.	0.9229497725669393
In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities.	0.9437863719610124
That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it.	0.907797967533015
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans.	1.054506006333254
Finally, this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity.	0.9494836884910595
A word on the White Paper: the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy.	0.7828045215277538
I shall take the floor very briefly, Madam President.	0.7603458569672981
Deciding upon future policy lines, with a view to a new directive, rather hastily, without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners, I feel, runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators.	1.011500423281568
In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas.	0.6905286851921361
While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general.	0.9199738700351512
We have no problem, Mr Newton Dunn, in repeating this information to you in writing, but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here, because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly.	1.2340287418244
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.	1.1026287497856537
It is therefore the Commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions.	0.9192428877498563
Tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the EU.	0.772622507080776
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.	0.7993786075208125
It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal.	1.088335483776007
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject.	0.766184563220358
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.	0.5849005931231775
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.	0.8540321656514631

For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion.	1.1999926026815528
In fact, renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives.	0.7675757623656245
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court.	0.9841862712381149
We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction.	0.8793666148659999
In terms of the IGC issue, I have a specific question for you. I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF.	1.2500443601742588
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.	0.5780189969022844

Although there has been some slippage, I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon.	0.833849488404051
When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on.	1.220335862236349
I saw the newly-elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely impressed, as others have been, by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism.	0.8318295093865498
However, I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used.	0.8619963032826822
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.	0.9001654915741782
Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar.	1.1455174033435918
(FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers.	0.9121894189717985
Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission.	1.0908497329792974
We want information from the Russian authorities as to Mr Babitsky' s whereabouts and his state of health.	0.5299371316725435
During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.	0.9278344832898306
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount.	0.8285754637032845
As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.	1.0492746219083948
Mr President, I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members' questions this time round. On his first appearance in November this was not possible, although this was not Mr Solana' s fault.	1.0222342317683288
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.	0.5955763342514766
River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought.	0.625856506685158
Mr President, I will try to be brief in answering the Member' s question. The regional development plan submitted by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not indicate how the Community funds will be allocated among the Spanish Objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive.	0.8333009755986592
However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal. It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves.	1.0669482496378753
Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational.	0.7707147744364804
We insist on this.	0.2743618461223793
Moreover, the Commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which, according to Article 23, it was to submit by 31 December 2000.	1.057713380988407
Report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS))	0.6733156926315064
We also have to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers.	0.9674921767087001
. (FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	0.9761766499058204
Mr President, there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance.	0.8618557536412552
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.	0.649755090021702
What we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable.	1.1132466127169047
I hope that this is a misunderstanding.	1.2225751974038572
I propose to confine my comments to two areas.	0.6091957402117008
Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources, it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements.	0.8277646728921692
Community policy in the field of water (continuation)	0.6778226498240524
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance.	0.9844742181488748
It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree.	0.9729996159126626
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated.	0.8305839908176591

We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years.	0.4687181217900534
The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable.	0.6719489143620079
The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34(2)(b) of the Treaty.	0.6799713664071866
Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment.	1.1534312215230949
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form.	0.7800634660965905
Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts.	0.5520662437505626
That is usually the case.	0.423085617396027
I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal.	1.185270920573026
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have.	1.2161604536968518
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities.	0.7950514284769237
Cultural diversity is important, and it is under threat.	0.9109143969585733
Quite the reverse, in fact. At present, there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them, and a decent one at that.	0.9779658077644864
What, then, are the values of these Socialists who feathered their electoral nest in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in glowing colours for the benefit of the underprivileged, and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants, full-time union officials and state capitalism?	0.7824104705075301
There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally.	1.095609160587502
Madam President, I am pleased about the fact that, in Austria, the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes, in my eyes, a huge victory for democracy.	1.0708061081128912
May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows?	0.7582147758291692
According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds.	0.9205429031567247
Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive.	1.1342799595149116
The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote, as in the European elections and, in the worst case scenario, to extremist voting patterns.	1.0006094327417343
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.	0.9319411088937231
We should not be bribing these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction, giving them money to absorb laws which are as alien to their culture as a black hole is to Mother Earth.	0.8210299295904063
That is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in Austria; for the Austrian People' s Party, the ÖVP, wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability. The ÖVP wants to ensure that we continue to meet the Maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit, as we have agreed here.	1.1753802524317367
The first question, then, is about who should pay.	0.9938717068959313
We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame.	0.6095372218471897
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated.	0.9185644404709679
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.	1.1065906918293469
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms.	0.8163518694301576
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.	0.9566113270517913
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT.	0.617819733798959
In other words, the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis.	0.8351729955947349

We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission' s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy.	1.0395232846972233
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage.	0.6929702802290791
Parliament would, of course, welcome this with open arms. If this were possible, it would be a huge, historic victory.	1.0045296303719449
The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year.	0.7884246738946324
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it.	1.134192969661803
We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet, so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point.	0.8682068080910547
You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different.	0.9529595093973864

The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.4319819887740932

It was, in fact, in Macedonia that I heard at the time about the Roma population actually not having too bad a time there.	0.8767794436043043
Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report.	0.7725553814123106
Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.	1.0216361492278967
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.	0.7348434948176855
VOTE	-0.0
With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document.	1.172175075045281

I understand your concern, Mr Napolitano, and an interinstitutional working group will be set up. Its first meeting should take place in March.	1.2103636592143778

Joint resolution on Austria	0.430668393997546
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.	0.6732990945149633
This regulation is purely instrumental.	0.5033278210901121
As I see it, this means that Mr Haider' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament.	0.6660629279911198
One last word regarding the programme. I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there.	1.0635541125308166
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field.	0.7736026216900341
It is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries, which will no doubt have implications for competition, which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations.	1.0528645243835721
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.	0.9538026454031413
Having been crushed beneath the heel of triumphant Communism, this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s.	0.6745115739808404
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.	1.0444421778643984
Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki.	0.8720942820602873
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million.	0.4762310897411422
I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in.	0.726333410072571
The foregoing is the reason for our vote.	0.6336430985536805
Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.	1.0074479569029688
Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable?	0.6455616293181148
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that.	0.6180313226293859
We are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery, which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies.	0.9248541761392224
We must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the European Union without having stood trial and that, in some states, custody is abused and used as a means of extorting confessions.	0.9392803447244416
Mr President, I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote, on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report.	1.0549885590023549
We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual.	0.9668696335903304
In this way, a decision-making system can be created that is more effective, clearer, more open and more democratic.	0.9191824747703035
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.	0.7240673158206559
If these do not materialise, then, unfortunately, convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us, and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions, despite the size of the amounts committed, will end in failure.	0.8384090507636129
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.	0.9585665381814418
But, quite apart from this, we would like to emphasise that, if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union, we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself.	1.0986222796856684
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.	1.004191612431831
Especially in situations of war, civilians are given less consideration all the time.	0.6049819460876149
Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council.	1.0162413929516063
First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented.	1.2315974354297847
Mr President, I wanted to point out an important matter of principle.	1.0800532473407902
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.	0.8841828035755421
Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.	0.8125868239566237
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission.	0.4589417188183314
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper's proposals on the authority.	1.090683360671911
All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance.	0.7831362194990231
Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers, who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad?	0.6849054913069247
It is a retrograde step.	0.9681331654355328
As far as excessive paper is concerned, the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan.	0.6804897930893409
I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.	0.7892981917074814
As a farmer myself, I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk.	1.017366303111253
In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.	1.0770836048352777
However, we must be vigilant in the face of global operators, against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits.	0.856510119128082
This is a political question which, in the short term, requires an answer from the IGC and this Parliament.	1.0958067463239853
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders.	0.7205815891481469
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.	0.8547511791995644
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve.	0.9479214286097083
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter.	1.1831294666092094
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.	1.0451277559608394
I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation.	0.8756130014437428
However, even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management' s attitude is socially irreprehensible.	0.820013095612526
Nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy. How can the whole of the European Union treat, in this way, two small countries situated on its periphery?	1.053958513827963
Firstly, there is the concern that some have expressed, in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, President of the Committee on Economic Affairs, of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty.	1.0831138137598628
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence, such as the Carrefours.	0.9196184331335624
From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.	0.8645402282032737
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission' s operations are clearly in no one' s interest.	0.5348631281962521
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading.	0.8545978436019978
Lastly, Mr Balfe has complained that there are, in his opinion, too many limits in the whole proposal the Commission has put forward.	1.1054143243895747
Today, as previously in the history of Europe, right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life.	0.8391193491900896
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones.	0.7681760919021781
This reminds us that tourism cannot be regarded as the poor countries' petroleum industry, because it requires huge investment in structures, infrastructures, entrepreneurship, professional expertise, social services and training; that the tourist industry is essential for the equilibrium of many regions as it provides a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activities: agriculture, small firms in the industrial and craft sector, transport, services, retail sector, training, etc; that the development of the Community' s tourist industry is closely linked to its sustainability with regard to the Community objectives; that the varied geography and historical, cultural and environmental heritage must be protected and exploited.	0.799922497931098
Mr President, this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission' s and Council' s efforts in this respect.	1.0848177314767486
The Council?	-0.0
Let us be honest.	0.49710291141665064
By embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial privatisations we have also witnessed in Germany, we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation, which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise!	0.9524889289304628
As was emphasised at Tampere, and as part of our preparations for the Feira European Council in June 2000, we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross-pillar policy strategies, which strengthen the links between the Union' s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the Union' s position on the world stage.	1.0143167617609934
I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region!	1.070629225598871
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?	1.0525037286978303
At present, the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first, while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security.	0.9102038160137784
The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan.	0.47548295121980705
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement.	0.7744006846750495
For Greece, for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, the social and economic restoration of the Balkans, bringing political stability, is a vitally important matter.	1.066342685307099
But Europe is changing.	0.42183995759625303
Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.	0.8866288502058108
Recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Ms Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the proposal for a Council decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (11221/1999 - COM(1998) 249 - C5 - 0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC))	0.647889842820632
This is why it is necessary - and Mr Van Hecke has already mentioned this, and this is also what we clearly ask for in our resolution - that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area is reassessed.	0.9797467271011869
Mr President, the facts are well-known.	1.0041212285514078
Besides, we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries.	0.7181478936481318
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):	0.22058740364930896
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.	0.9962482999935738
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.	0.8644227594979236
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.	0.9427082382564343
Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government?	0.8417274362234809
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual' s own personality; it builds relationships and communicates.	0.9542725875306186
While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem.	0.7246730175087539
That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges, with each Member States drawing up its own scheme, so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected.	1.0066027235484751
Hence his disappearance of over one month.	0.31482107225804873
In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending.	0.7978749252762078
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk, many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels.	1.0086750310034236
However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months.	0.8478170672766072
The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based.	1.0557806690446907
Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked.	0.6674820918534571
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.	1.0971639715979065
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium.	0.5444332997151644
These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them.	1.044589965742801
Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water.	0.6989223115533968
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities.	0.3789810858607365
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union.	0.8920767497915166
It is true, I admit it, and you are well aware of the reasons, ladies and gentlemen.	1.2690437737022504
Mrs Schroedter' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid.	0.787345592046013
However, we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium, so as to give a fresh impetus, while preserving continuity, to the work done under the previous action plan.	1.1972483357929773
For example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France, whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom.	1.0070308697242427
I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations.	0.6839917809455718
We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity.	0.8668018636815172
As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote: "Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts".	0.8681447802272451
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.	0.9168753466874012
The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making, but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent.	0.8039658025569979
Thirdly: the extension to Parliament' s rights in this context.	0.8366417501902917
In creating a citizens' Europe, social policy has an important role to play.	0.7828626737867632
Mr President, Commissioner, Kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that "it is happening within their own nation" .	0.6676620092174077
Madam President, this afternoon, in this Chamber, reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning, which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House.	0.853758761776668
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up.	0.7986081344068785
Given the oral amendment, we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done.	1.2782596566026283
Now who should pay the costs?	0.7437339880771148
The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water.	0.5189493968178177
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.	0.6364572604238412
This, indeed, is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	0.9210882346514656
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand: anything is open for discussion, as long as the budget stays fixed.	0.89012594049756
Consequently, the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades.	1.0955828474393754
Having said this, Madam President, I am prepared, once again, to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy.	0.8926075599994151
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.	1.0647085687018412
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods	0.15980580172328768
Mr President, unlike several of those who have spoken in today' s debate, I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report, one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission' s communications.	1.088359696819594
The Council' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret.	0.7809105758130482
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.	0.8884200241508208
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation.	0.9304645342259249
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: "The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme.	0.9641130836977456
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	0.198121543677809
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence. It is something that is earned over a period of time.	0.8504682989355485
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months.	0.7315665933961232
I condemn this, as well as the Council' s absence.	0.8424793081882597
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone.	0.9582303467952779
We have tried to drive this proposal through.	0.39864629865430035
Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment.	0.6514754223454604
Before discussing the content of the resolution, I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur.	0.7558425036184472
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty.	1.021081117940809
I shall therefore, with your permission, give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion.	0.9435845852551855
This is a key priority for us to focus on.	0.9734825586590017
The division of Yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept, regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way.	1.0498942324482416
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.	1.2353740180300785
My basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives, in which one' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services.	1.027055958940267
Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are.	1.037650618846878
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves.	1.1938339643699785
The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions.	1.017653309519773
In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population.	1.0663181489599431
I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection, despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR.	0.7109034597706335
I do think, though, that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks, which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case.	1.1587101246146445
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy?	0.6183391342110933
In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines.	0.8892544465845732
Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy.	1.0722563937364786
We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming, allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme.	0.7008098798748343
In Zambia 25% of teachers have died of AIDS.	0.5113079796642962
As the presidency has noted, the Union as a whole is considering its position.	1.0792708161625548
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99):	0.1858975677685528
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission' s good intentions, but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions.	0.966711378844713
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.	0.8623049086654836
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation	1.1458799866652811
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.	1.0295944476715697
The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries.	0.9375157018395985
As has always been the case, there are offences that transcend European offences, as it were, or at least there is the potential for them to do so, and these might include money-laundering, receiving stolen goods, and forming a criminal organisation.	1.0888965066907321
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions.	0.9709871380315811
I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect.	0.8376219346352474
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote.	0.6712182727912492
I hope that, in the future, things will change and meetings will become frequent, because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude, as quickly as possible, those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women.	1.0350125091616171
Finally, Mr President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply, in our own administration, with the demands we are making on others.	1.1593456082986002
We must not waiver in that commitment.	0.793429700661423
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice.	0.5620648384730556
This means that the ceiling of 0.25% mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance.	0.7626794922713974
I, personally, would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report.	0.8818132202899989
It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean.	0.889336011646175
But I - and many Members with me - also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate.	1.0383334966070188
Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems.	0.9747267531338536
The "physico-chemical and ecological quality of water" was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals, and the adverse effects of other aspects was, at best, touched upon marginally.	0.9767838434030746
I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously.	0.7811148228522728
I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric.	0.9538900057526638
However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings.	1.2367617376598297
A number of codes have since been introduced.	0.5260572417018254
This issue is extremely serious.	0.7611510984599283
We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding.	0.836414033296967
In the meantime, I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication.	0.7808042342398762
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000.	0.8685289334375109
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation.	0.7603661007580077
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit.	0.865232141447403
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware.	0.89326343170511
It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	0.6772612376682102
The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements.	0.9567061534986072
Over the past couple of years, a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and, more especially, the Lomé countries.	0.8723403598804497
Madam President, coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks.	0.958260172347481
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty.	0.564054798416408
Never mind that the Commission' s requirement to produce an annual report, set out clearly in the Council resolution, has produced only one "non-paper" , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards.	0.8100621747827422
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on.	0.8136702911320521
Firstly he talked about verification.	0.2443258782372597
That is also mentioned in the report.	0.8088274111147818
I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union, which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view.	1.2705929773635145
It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa.	0.8812766830248884
Mr Désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides.	0.41607931037382256
A government must have more nerve and more courage.	0.6499882696583208
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50.	0.9873901064689795
Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided.	1.1106586504720457
We really have not progressed very far.	0.6557287147433772
Secondly, we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months, for instance, the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners, the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong.	0.9948345296912859
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments.	1.0897813882157867
I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect?	0.913859176379205
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.	0.6438253748803979
We will proceed to the debate itself and Mr Monti will take the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.8795351651589218
We are still in the process of preparing a text, and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment.	0.9508575399575766
Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union' s budget but the EDF remains outside it.	0.7018956300624039
How would you describe this?	0.29872009554651185
The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him.	1.169636290652434
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency.	0.541690660735908
In voting against the Jonckheer report, I wish to assert the need for another policy, to wit, ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff.	0.85378155582783
What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them.	0.9215925933798527
In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain.	0.5904209059697904
I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them.	1.0403427257523505
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap.	0.4445390656870017
When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr Böge referred to will be asked.	0.9628128686833965
I can only fully share your concern.	0.6662086461070231
Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort.	0.8786237815852227
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union.	0.927593155091458
The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context.	0.7023240089722382
The fact that an openly extremist, racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project. The European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either.	1.0214192149466712
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat.	0.8294111257193427
The post office is democracy.	0.5373608740831215
Perhaps this is also why, as is rumoured to be the case, the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well.	1.2746462944841936
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened.	0.9997456555768026
It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted.	0.8002995745094907
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations.	1.039650510151127
Nevertheless, we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late.	1.1135171756157787
The precautionary principle is not a new concept.	0.9940059572266959
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated.	0.5065870021511143
(In successive votes, Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)	0.6673206345193372
If today we do not staunchly support the Council, then history will judge us, saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement.	0.7759038884114263
Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission - although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union' s Member States?	1.0545504939644759
The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else, at an affordable stamp price.	0.7060300823136189
Two hundred years ago it was liberty, equality and fraternity, and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others.	0.69903892009149
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.	1.2008413142751462
Many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan's report.	0.7228501554048727
The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.	0.7892630443898182
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth.	0.9098885724551784
If no definitions are provided in questions such as this, it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world, with no uniformity of approach.	0.8648734396963224
Mr President, in the small amount of time allotted to me, I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann' s report and remind the House of three principles, to which all other principles must be subordinate, which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur' s amendments: water is not a commercial product, but the property of all the peoples of the Union; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater, and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity.	1.0566056957436025
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.	0.9512452997082569
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines, although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds.	1.0296361480408547
Monsieur Bolkestein, je veux vous dire quelque chose!	0.24736814315181888
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes.	0.7112062286648454
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information?	0.5547833276430231
Of course, if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference, there might eventually be progress.	0.9838214946801729
Mr President, Commissioner, let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it makes the basic statistical data for an economic and monetary union directed at stability and real growth more harmonised, directly comparable and more accurate.	0.9064459141553756
The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold.	0.5642670009610364
Mr President, the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars.	0.7983627885669015
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme.	0.8776279863817638
As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within.	0.737152469653444
The EU must not take on a masculine persona.	0.7777327734808981
We have thrown water a life-belt.	0.3824813116989477
Like a previous speaker, I also fully support the appeals which have been made.	1.1476495495994792
Madam President, I believe I am expressing the feeling of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political groups when I say that the message which the President of the Commission sent to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago created some unease.	1.1983514284416112
Mr President, the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989, mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors.	0.7574001594114859
We need, in short, to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these.	0.8727303996828215
Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation?	0.598192917750699
The Commission confirmed then, as it does today, that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency' s statement of 1 February 2000.	1.1447414364903015
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations, consumer protection associations and the public.	1.0620950536070457
The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully.	0.6600596095921851
I refer to Eurodac.	0.537656658436806
It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other, alongside the Council members, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually, every day, what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest.	0.9661254224109966
In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union.	1.0518389270657873
What is the Commissioner' s opinion of this?	0.8324607801200445
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.13242161209497053
Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned.	0.6570695803847774
Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created.	0.5414296584684092
A French-owned ship, under a Maltese flag of convenience, an Indian crew, a sea-worthiness certificate issued by Italy, in Sicily, with the last inspection carried out in Bulgaria, I think.	1.0403445798272961
So we come back to the previous problem.	0.812036758063579
I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom.	0.9141702784083194
And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content.	0.914534313923144
This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society, and also important from the point of view of effectiveness, for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently.	0.9507746988626288
Consequently, I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement.	0.8185245160571446
. (DA) The Left' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER+, the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG, but not URBAN.	1.1511611435295446
The water issue will definitely not be settled today.	0.4793343931262572
I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.	0.9626314231160854
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.	0.5733268496345874
I would therefore advocate that the EUR 15 million in category 4 be dropped, in line with the Commission' s proposal.	0.978722189166296
My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one.	0.9930829647234785
The debate is closed.	0.11842509771331887
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position.	0.9570462265475521
Was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success, or to say, "I am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms" , or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation?	0.8289903220562364
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom, security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon, which has been accepted, will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists.	0.8503911627476876
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.	1.2444701598623795
In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland.	1.1680043705032417
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area?	0.7464774068239162
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age, gender or origin.	0.6693140504308414
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed.	0.7945661040858752
For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission.	0.8441619383209836
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.	0.8856279746246858
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points, detail and precision are obviously essential.	0.5474357374667872
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring' s negotiations.	0.7749769929022756
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency.	0.7577513205490835
Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.	0.8005781323454207
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission's administration with the public.	0.9862072031155006
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments.	0.6401028732469065
We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth, but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time, even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points.	0.9987574906848394
I come from a rural area.	0.5790174254861246

There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border.	0.7240652265833802
In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people.	0.6469482936370997
We are well aware that, in the European Union, a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation. With LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility, the validity of the objectives of these directives, and their capacity to be implemented.	1.060256030714812

Let us grab our chance.	0.19196143987135178
Firstly, I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and, secondly, on the need for transparency with regard to this aid.	1.098819392065116
Third point: specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women, but also immigrants and refugees, must be envisaged.	0.9590937375717676

Under the European Community' s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million.	0.5801682021198212
Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility.	1.0139472671990688
I utterly reject this!	0.2242801707280873

The legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation, i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years, would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances.	0.9814586122191238
Turning to judicial cooperation, in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings.	0.8753109613323937
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies.	0.8155440833747862

Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks.	1.0088857243559393

EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer.	0.9307564174209961
There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future.

This report contains 34 conclusions, including 15 calls to the Commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection, particularly in outermost and island regions.	1.059427037323411

Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming.	1.4043448857737395
In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen.	0.9575829159945595
If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development, it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job.	0.9776151185399878

The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags.	0.8878883289405544
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.	0.9553531960167438

- (FR) The Commission' s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now 81 and 82) certainly does not propose any "renationalisation" of competition policy, as some Members of the European Parliament fear.	0.864676708243045

I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems: Asturias.	0.6212619655368434
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.	0.9290634239936958
This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities. The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly.	1.0470215686479678
I am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for European tourism.	0.7549738197017113
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East.	0.7300694624140038
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.	1.1001963705530728
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement.	0.9016330795711044
I want to emphasise, however, that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.	1.0618168978776246
The Council and Commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4.	0.8220202580710257

The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up.	0.7336051241752448

What are we to do now?	0.6571021467268572
Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now.	0.8202703995935606
In this way, we would have no problem in acting immediately. We would not create problems for the Kosovar people, but, on the other hand, we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing.	1.2697811258876308
Nevertheless, Mr Alavanos, the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount, in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise, and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground.	1.1248437449319832

But that cannot be helped.	0.5417643354955299
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa.	0.8647668879031761

It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chevènement as the globalised élites.	1.0067669281007663
However, the Commission believes that we must go further.	1.3611117245506263

In my opinion, the best thing the Council could do would be to cease occupying that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides, with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another, independent country.	1.0861221791274098
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria, but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue.	0.9326794347905011
Madam President, this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time.	0.8285026610826474
I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament, but I also note the compromises and the omissions in it.	1.140607810183168
Even more serious is the government' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal.	0.5631517349042354
At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands.	0.9469157032120503

Just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales.	0.827308905036425
Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in economic and political terms, will remain shaky, weak and limited, perhaps inadequate, if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view.	1.16490523387121
Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union.	1.0238136091456125

Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda.	1.230892798171014

Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force.	0.8801094221935786
A paper this short is a farce.	0.2724361297504229
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision.	0.9795614565603729
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.7693910260913137
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.	0.9980628654851337
What happened in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we are not careful.	1.0032547233533717
The creation of this taxation, of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Lauré, could prove to be politically opportune, at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate. This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States.	0.8123732315471953
This is what is meant by the term "close-to-zero" .	0.7538004901438102
We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies.	0.8786282373842293
I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied.	0.8809696046029492
That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension.	1.1405734660232663
- (FR) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy.	0.8634995180510749
At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin.	0.9359941864428418
This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency.	0.715955199426145
Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now.	0.8912867959329817
In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary.	0.7540559078654742
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first.	0.5857183409839284
What guarantees are there of its reliability?	0.2986523624731803
In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.	1.1344192789875556
Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources.	0.8611016510031223
The Swedish Christian Democrats would emphasise the value of the European Union' s and the European Parliament' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction.	0.835551082955299
Resumption of the session	0.09428392457092542
Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them.	0.9436837164674963
This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution.	1.1612443141003135
Nevertheless, I should like to ask two questions: Are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations, for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations?	0.7725716299634178
Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave.	1.014578806750028
It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge.	0.9844553485949913
Subject: High infant mortality levels in Kosovo According to the most recent UN information forwarded to the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe. About 50% of premature babies do not survive and the war has resulted in a massive increase in the number of miscarriages.	0.662017226644163
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because, in their view, it might break up European policy on competition, which is to say, in plain terms, attacking the standardising superstate.	1.1155286326949256
We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society.	1.123217255479808
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that.	1.126582778591912
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report.	1.079639836012257
Yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory. In this theory, on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples, their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations, new policies or new, restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.8613605454733206
Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman.	1.2579858093939291
One urgent question is therefore raised: why, when this programme has been successfully run for ten years, is LEADER+ still classed as experimental?	0.9475585867932123
At the end of the day, Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan.	0.5792393924231038
Anyone, therefore, who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian, should examine their own motives in the context of a debate, which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world.	0.7919697847912345
Is this possible?	0.3415339642110715
Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a "service provision card plus notification for each individual contract" system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract.	0.8730782903120895
It was very small.	0.41815882740744925
As far as Mr Papayannakis' question is concerned, in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment, the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment.	0.878923824028885
We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project.	0.6644643458397645
It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible.	0.7157034929118461
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending.	1.028915938017076
I am referring ,of course, to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the basic elements of which I would like to restate.	1.2076088769327282
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason.	0.7171787235428032
Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations.	1.221300377234495
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up.	0.8735878874259256
It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union, a little-known, almost always implicit flaw, but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens' loss of interest.	1.0246068692969141
First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.	1.0527407504324895
We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group.	0.6278321821721697
In the future, funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone.	0.7006354160473803
We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood.	1.0123540678960163
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate.	0.43293238455401883
That is why we want annual reports, we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure, to make sure action is actually taken.	1.1545793285317327
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.	0.8276715662551511
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind.	1.012858436137249
It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable.	0.7022000121356143
I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided.	0.9595238914748048
You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty.	1.078119900037431
Nor do I think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial.	1.028968565792488
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.	0.5114334700646614
The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary, for our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and in an EMU era, social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition.	1.0693953339873243
Madam President, as everyone has said, this is a very important day. It is the day of the first debate of European political life.	1.2589990362081918
It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words.	0.7142772241939102
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible.	0.6241273288344596
In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.	1.0774370118985732
We, the social democrats, would urge the opposition to back these ideas.	1.0476402283703343
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence.	1.2440233007130574
Fourthly, as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE, it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget.	0.8161359172078412
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter.	0.8226209413683855
Every year, nearly 200 million Europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel, usually to other countries in Europe.	0.6984701993104842
We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which pointed out that, as far as approximating laws is concerned, Article 37 is adequate in this case.	0.8334844851957501
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.	0.7131171870262676
The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives.	0.7298768377577427
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made.	1.059467382845575
It is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders.	0.8937365049954025
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops.	0.7838966686325216
The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs.	0.6387217188932939
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised.	0.9806159718422329
This applies to them and us.	0.8011249408006216
Mr President, Commissioner, the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society.	1.0361548016378441
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it.	1.1001582632702545
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.	1.1187150664734689
Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS))	0.6838086168042972
Otherwise, we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.0764811650571937
Our internal borders, or what remains of them, no longer cause wars, but they do continue to generate economic backwardness, social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe.	0.8929925870547769
Mr President, I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work.	0.731808273942663
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.	1.2577080789474846
Let me just itemise them: the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy, particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the Member States.	1.0828974759985854
This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100, the ten so-called "strongest" regions reached an average of 158, and the ten so-called "weakest" regions reached a figure of around 50.	0.7111342007311476
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)	0.4800209879392463
The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects.	0.7846527665523021
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime.	0.49620641067119087
In the light of the above, will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by Parliament?	0.9975743475888967
We do not accept this agreement, which deprives people of the wherewithal to build societies which are independent of the European multinationals and banks.	0.8781925186954158
The polluter should pay.	0.33806284099761336
B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance	0.6332894733461705
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because, for certain, many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale.	0.737587918242805
Quality, sustainability, innovation are at the forefront of the Commission' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the Council of Ministers.	1.007861076861298
The truth is that the European Parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about Europe, as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections.	0.9102249361699993
It will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products.	0.565939022582874
It makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ.	0.5894888646480959
I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2.	0.9783884215906099
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.	0.9548809235874524
How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place?	0.8872162682819151
We must point out, however, that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased, the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of 'Agenda 2000' and the WTO. The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up, to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences.	0.9083447269249294
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason.	0.6392089344216578
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately.	0.689184299889736
The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women.	0.7675021198036476
Mr President, I want to thank you for your answer. I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt asked.	0.8546691158087772
In a sense this is where its work begins.	0.7135014390720039
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions.	0.8700910129681828
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.	0.9699940854918919
Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means.	0.7091059541923193
After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.	0.7446524948333978
I share the Commission' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined.	0.8181034981597246
Because, as well as the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry, the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry, to the conservation of marine resources, and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.	0.9145092129625293
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation.	0.7906808326859278
The first concerns the manufacturer' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles.	0.6263840159111922
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.	0.42418625984395797
The Council approved the agreement negotiated by the Commission despite the fact that a basic section, namely agriculture, had not been finalised.	0.9359573996339313
But what about the human rights policy within the EU itself?	0.9608987840245979
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority.	0.4841557348346161
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did.	0.9431343920250207
The most important parts of Parliament' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle.	0.6393594731738408
One also wonders whether this 'coordinated modernisation strategy' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people.	0.6978670723959801
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration.	0.8079119736007586
This is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament.	0.9569016374925534
No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament.	0.72608248881643
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them.	0.7778390949731165
Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so.	0.9254358470507531
I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion.	1.0189595890164032
(The Minutes were approved)	0.2501466592596904
Mrs van der Laan' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work, and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997.	1.1334699733050217
Essentially, my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment.	0.9959879470548385
The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.	1.0027569874514437
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are addressing a very important sector that directly involves over 10 million jobs in the European Union and helps the more or less disadvantaged, island and remote areas to stand on their own feet.	0.694091683630755
Madam President, today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles.	1.0878543010075898
But if we are to secure the public' s participation in this new planning, we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	0.8849213688908226
Mr President, I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer, but like almost all of us, I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom, security and justice.	0.9957166202283568
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry.	0.7806298859319353
Like the work on employment, the Commission' s proposal is founded upon four pillars.	0.9413124726596777
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available.	1.1392487156660278
For this reason, it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests, and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States.	1.092143235103288
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation.	0.5886261916125299
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?	0.9673521478368369
The debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange securities, the two main market stability indicators, have, for some time, been at danger levels, as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrates.	1.1834919119310527
We therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania, reaching as far as Belgrade, but above all, the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues.	0.8057613038367502
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.	0.9744154529052671
Against this background, my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million, since we know, and I think it bears saying, how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is, especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice.	0.9720187780586709
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	0.5914363953237822
It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole.	0.7820462800173777
Those responsible for what happened in El Ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants. We must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution.	0.7867660950022659
The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer, say, EUR 2 million.	0.6406200801258061
I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work.	0.7301500393000115
So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans.	0.8092426804043225
It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote.	0.8559360830295819
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue.	0.6873278267163305
So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe.	1.0889569981298584
That legislative framework is the 1995 directive, which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously.	0.7958844866655846
The same day, I conveyed my own and the European Parliament' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims' families.	0.7891207302402816
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States.	0.5834944915110546
This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries, which accounts for 69% of the total work force there compared with 1.7% in the EU.	0.8320800322694628
In my view, products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products, namely, those that can be seen and touched.	0.778805526650661
We must give them this opportunity.	0.6365660945285372
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive.	0.561658335628917
Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States' policies with the European Union' s development policy.	0.820133054009518
The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly.	0.8880061504728903
Congratulations on your maiden speech: It went really well.	0.6073988161953607
I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council.	1.296252465897203
When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators.	0.8267127848856718
In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety.	0.9033999432165533
We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market, just like other citizens of the European Union.	0.7706599223759176
It will not do for one type of policy, probably with many exceptions and adaptations, to be applied.	1.0351381451742725
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step.	0.8255469818619008
At midday, Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region.	0.909435349244846
Clare Short, MP, is one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and, as such, can take her case to the very heart of government.	0.9823056401290309
Pensioners will, in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal.	1.2459858628038016
This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today.	0.7577155523236888
However, there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs, and there needs to be.	1.1288685972595358
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.	0.7774761284828265
I understand this.	0.3522837599448607
I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations.	1.0849867295138678
Once again, all your fine examples, your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground.	0.9917491516776649
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.	0.9068586254025435
All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025.	1.1057438600267508
Instead, we have been forced to debate the formal, substantial errors that have been made in the last few days.	1.204840875218408
The partnership between the European Union and the ACP was negotiated in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium.	1.133606070569758
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions, which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly.	1.139010897982554
Madam President, I strongly refute any statement, demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism.	0.6171636913373055
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense.	0.7852253110828389
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones.	0.6953282093205386
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible.	0.8257684722585105
The debate is closed.	0.17074919906824898
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important.	0.6272252509684709
The second point relates to Syria.	0.5151222224017684
Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems.	0.5673667356020233
In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt.	1.216380868366486
This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament' s position on the case all the more appropriate, as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence.	0.7767392415308279
It is the western world itself which is partly to blame.	0.8817810085459401
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6613648262672298
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities.	1.053707506722579
Rather than banning flags of convenience, which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet, under the 1995 EU directive on port state control, national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations.	0.9132244881663338
We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten.	0.9902608154408262
In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.	0.9022688288698757
Madam President, we are therefore working on this issue with determination, energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government.	1.3084467617303264
We do not agree with this type of tax because its application, in the event that it could happen, would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive.	1.029174168075798
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety.	0.7675661287796683
Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe.	1.0127141663314005
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.	0.8058096351627644
My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget.	0.6000461011713711
Amendment No 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of Article 22a are concerned, because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of Article 22, especially when the UCITS are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses, as discussed in the Council.	0.9665887506815541
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health.	0.6591232983749011
To set my fellow Members' minds at ease and to reassure them, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women' s participation in Community research programmes, which is, after all, a praiseworthy goal.	1.0035161844215645
In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.	0.7411280979127529
With regard to your specific concern, I can say that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission.	1.0819673121725146
In his millennium speech, he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death.	0.8207222303202781

The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union' s dependence on imported energy.	0.7018372722139253
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought, particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.	0.9442692982795065
Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Convention of Lomé and tackling famine situations?	0.9305043816923759
LEADER II (1994-1999), for which a total evaluation has, unfortunately, not yet been completed, had a wider scope than LEADER I: there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated, after reallocation of resources, probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million.	0.8872479522329382
Mr President, we take note that the excuse-making, reticent Presidency, which, in recent months, has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today, has come to an end.	1.1860541333699792
It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million.	0.6193756469926398
But is there not more to it than that?	0.5480285385218753
Even in the tourism industry.	0.9063602743389785
In particular, we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue.	0.9380090337757834
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	0.8040415937305516
I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre.	0.9283826426357495
Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem.	1.113135289458864
Finally, I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community' s environmental policy.	1.054656682916238

Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out.	0.41935774314331775
Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld.	1.2207746074300427
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme.	0.6348837771845526
As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock.	0.7517016697481296
What I would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate.	0.5860015800891045
Therefore, the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.	0.863580533976622
We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future.	0.9268261683001657
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries.	0.9479432895878498
Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry, growing financial services, good agriculture, magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities, all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources.	0.7151835504996952
There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process.	1.049247840977337
I also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in March 2000 are already based on the new ESA, i.e. the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant.	0.8764227972918976
It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy.	0.7706737496235551

The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive.	0.5845308574019563
I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about.	0.9134693783008747
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men.	0.8748854346682192
The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication.	0.9154532705031788
Mr President, I too believe that tourism has a very important role to play, not just in our European regions, but throughout the world, because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development.	1.3373756705436324
In doing so, Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak.	0.6873158571236919
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.	0.5900738673572133

Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.	0.9391854972086944
Subject: Environmental problems caused by the Drogheda Port Company development project, and the role of the Court of Auditors A major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interests has arisen in the area of the Boyne Estuary, Ireland, following a development project of the Drogheda Port Company.	0.8477733927387898
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers.	0.7768949130931728
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work?	0.6437411494778748
We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order.	1.010206072838641
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.	1.1823829175831386
I beg you to intervene.	0.43350079255937646
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land.	0.962254589376915
I ask Mr Nielson, in his summing-up, to directly address those points in the resolution.	1.0258299649002929
To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence.	0.7753968506808179
An important element of LIFE-Nature, which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network, is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities, so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity.	0.8121235091425686
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas.	0.9032176356496575
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given.	0.841136137152879

We therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime, drug-dealing and gangs.	0.4995952585451747
Think of last year' s deadly criticism of the Commission' s lack of propriety, ethics and accountability.	0.63626350221703
Such a view is not only a political cop-out, it is positively dangerous.	0.7718893608080398

Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange.	0.6784971208286948
But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed.	0.6973376348128616
This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market.	0.973318860205976
A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world, numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead.	0.9040589365594702
I should like to stress this point because it is paramount.	0.8884992710749542
First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?	1.1161734512829844
The first is the transfer of water between basin areas.	0.6988422862313373
Several Members have set out what seems to have happened.	0.621658502666664

Mr President, today' s debate comes under the sign of the snail, not because I ate such excellent snails here in Strasbourg yesterday but because the snail is a symbol of slow progress.	0.8380274997444928
Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them.	0.8657937535300507
Are you prepared to act upon it?	0.4955054655208784
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.	0.9655088856776681
The issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture, trade, environment and biodiversity, but herein lies the real problem: these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular.	1.1531446671769123
It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding.	1.1700838654001557
In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology.	0.7208626654146114

Madam President, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Graa Moura, and Commissioner Reding, for their contribution to the creation of this programme.	1.1369342221830896
One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about.	0.9252915731529802
He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includes the United Kingdom, are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders.	0.9861573161979218
The Council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field.	1.002700590260468
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and, within the College, we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions. I would thank you for your understanding in this matter.	1.0010694419702015
We also feel that, if Turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union' s relations, regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country, it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the European Union in its foreign relations.	0.9640556033176221
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the 'continentalisation' of the European Union.	0.6588893960159321

We agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds, this evening' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor; culture then, and an institutional aspect, the basis for structuring a vast community, a prerequisite for economic growth, and not the complete opposite, as Europe, in its cultural habits, has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past.	1.1011961674847397
I note that Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base.	0.6755533563407212
Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders?	0.656414846553588
If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation, Serbian provocation, Albanian provocation, etc. we are heading for war.	0.8857078830654614
Thank you very much.	0.42768795415414873
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?	0.7062658279949751
Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms.	1.043573131994749
In other words, we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics.	0.8592631662645408
First, the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF; clearly that is misguided.	0.9346032956796894
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development, because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective.	1.0696940554952532
European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread.	0.8445526187329812
Here, we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women, and the agencies that represent them, in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes.	1.1911850038886767
We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible.	1.1033021992907766
Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion.	0.9373671992430701
The delays in the Commission' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question.	0.7920130597630992
I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.	1.0370738817657523
If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation, then we must at least abstain from voting.	0.7867823738036483
On the other hand, we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down.	0.8336821734963376
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question.	0.8219252590300201
In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction.	0.9344220062651686
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.	0.43672152870188585
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	1.0684498717542263
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions.	1.008708068312034
By blocking the demands of the financial industry, the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall.	0.9843847187474736
It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting.	1.1467428646418831
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes.	1.043654924812067
A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.	0.9824884019662197
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table.	0.7710702113549842
Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say.	1.0776620162747381
. On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party, I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations.	1.1378311852093592
However, the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries.	0.9929094985711215
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague, Franz Fischler.	0.7101787024407361
However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about.	0.9228045280555246

Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible.	0.7405500103012639
In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities.	0.7993947700902453
But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of "normalisation" and "harm reduction" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people.	0.801681903212556
Firstly, I should like to mention some of my most important arguments.	1.052433722513891
As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious.	0.9066325624975548
Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.	1.0615512314869162
My Amendment No 47 is therefore a warning for amateurs.	0.8211565341598798
Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in the debate I am going to insist on certain aspects which, from an agronomic point of view, and since I come from a southern country, I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive.	1.097524596603737
Since then, the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation, they have exploded exponentially and without restraint.	0.7715380096614088
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000.	0.8157441933523752
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions.	1.1446354973843484
It has no right to do so.	0.5849211602697423
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion.	0.5599424351328292
Firstly, I agree with you entirely. Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned.	1.1329827699090411
The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process.	0.990905946677646
Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern.	0.6039548379707259
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission.	0.7063348921116057
I would, however, like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date.	1.012286330761087
In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do.	1.1922108747729532
And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry.	1.0190207357006669
It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials.	0.6256007849194405
Even though, as the Commission says, the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development, it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created, performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives.	0.8573849982162451
We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety.	0.6676533528624786
The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	0.9266290786079212
We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are.	0.9094610548670469
In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.	0.842230630878814
So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which, although it directly impacts on the European Union' s development policy, is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum, it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives.	1.0207424684815143
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	0.7852440153744947
I would like to point out that, within this broad consensus, there were some Groups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council.	1.0992687429689472
I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament.	0.7125215073073078
However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable.	1.1893689071133364
We need a directive in this area, and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure.	1.123018199672106
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	0.9854979611808257
The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible.	0.870138942346395
The cost is not insurmountable; nor is the task an impossible one.	0.6268195587380492
This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment.	1.1502867177826694
Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management.	0.9303189983494485

We agree that we should have better control of the finances.	1.1399280408021144
For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this.	0.680305516455475
If this happens, the United States' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention.	1.0843339966837342
In my opinion, the European Union can, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, supplement the action of the Member States and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures, such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the Treaties; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the Union, with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms: rural, environmental, cultural, conference-based, spa-related and sports-related tourism, and also tourism focusing on senior citizens, research and training; the amendment of Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences.	0.8493042625928912
If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security.	0.901029402314848
The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region, accompanied by other Council representatives.	0.9120997648386144

Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller.	0.7682577490574712
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.	0.9171853528841011
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	0.82149091335883
There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road.	0.8280323754669247
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.	1.1391256064530273
In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close.	0.9361167929184003

Question No 46 by (H-0052/00):	0.37182862137160955
On a final note, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports, which were far from easy to produce.	1.0584124602009728
This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed.	0.6422361669850538
And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action.	0.8127993416360291
Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.	1.154395969752929
I urge the House to support these changes.	0.9458615942501534

(Parliament adopted the resolution)	0.26249936542822855
Turkey's nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	0.4038279973321667
We are nonetheless, as is our right as well as our responsibility, telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand.	0.8080885024537916
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.	0.9942451611234153
Firstly, we need a successful European economy.	1.1760371434065207
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging.	1.2123289639337604
Especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened.	0.5729682939220578
Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate.	0.9900110605299297
That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation.	1.0909858693007144
In its draft guidelines, the Commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past.	0.7983618933692367
Furthermore, it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent.	0.6522835430600057
She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations, observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy, Mr Vidal-Quadras.	0.9818428823373707
This is particularly true of what Mrs McCarthy said about URBAN. I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her, for all you owe her as far as this is initiative, as well as, more generally, all we owe Parliament.	1.116599301393461
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.	0.7761099858855165
The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal.	1.09054919070838
It is, therefore, regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being.	0.5599769128518767
Although Mr Corrie' s report roundly condemns this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly' s attachment to the Lomé model, he fails to highlight properly a second problem which, to tell the truth, is also the result of the free-trade error, namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreements signed by the European Union.	1.028714758334327

Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.	1.0231879373633088
Let us, in particular, focus attention on the re-admission clauses, which present a threat to the Geneva Convention and which should be blocked.	0.9144794700923717
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment.	0.5013637420032191
We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us.	1.278952778390051
The common position, which was arrived at with great difficulty in the Council, which the Commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, complies fully with the environmental requirements. I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers' liability.	0.9222627886139056
However, the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	1.1080024209157682
The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators.	0.6089916465695889
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.	0.9683292018492953
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee.	0.6280255505329656

In return for this, however, we want early notification obligations to be discontinued, rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them, and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting.	1.0567453364632398
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments.	0.8007843569038731

Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great, proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund, but where, at the same time, in relation to unemployment - as you wrote, Mrs Schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions. This is a situation which is, as it should be, unjustifiable and intolerable.	1.0183012597012255
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations.	1.0116704262604643
By way of paradox, I could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report, for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken, the more the world of crime will gloat and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious.	0.8576459362653909
It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area, since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory.	0.8425721336693807
Although the market is presented as the only rule which applies to ACP-EU relations, the European Union also plans to police immigration, as article 13 hints, in order to justify the policy of the European states against illegal immigrants.	1.0032234280856307
Further to your questions on the pre-electoral period, I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non-governmental organisations.	0.9957274866451382
These and other specific measures included in my report can, in my view, lend added value to the actions that the competent national and regional authorities should foster, in order to promote tourism and create new jobs, starting with the adoption of positive fiscal measures to assist small and medium-sized firms, particularly by reducing the burden of charges on labour.	0.8135972847691161
The key factor in this text as it has been amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties.	0.9896578095463874

Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out, or remind, the representative of the Commission that, in Belgium, the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence, right to be reunited with their families, etc.	1.0425499607829838

One of the programme's aims is to develop and supervise methods, strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility.	0.8611346387072323
Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance, assistance to victims and related activities.	0.5682602906995946
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect.	0.5381021422848004
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview.	1.0446984793375882
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter.	0.9759122781144377
This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation, albeit in a prudent manner.	0.774451559487856
We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability.	1.0478639363573181
We welcome that, and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision, we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law.	0.9975371153184129
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc.	0.9096591315695803
The Commission' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie.	0.6418844675299858
Why should this be the case?	0.7213643550494154
Madam President, as a Padanian taxpayer, I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Prodi, since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well.	0.8788896134938207
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.	0.9020193613308659
My Group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution, for two reasons: firstly because this creates selective responsibility.	0.8453102835867766
The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them.	0.6197450329693731
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters.	0.6675753810723903
The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years.	0.9183981637027547
I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government.	0.6723289363740856
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.	0.5039509883009946
That means that since the days of mail-coaches and taxis, we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services.	0.8730440876522043
Finally, our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back, not to both branches of the legislative authority, but to the Council alone, which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure.	1.0550337280049613
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States, especially Britain and France, seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty.	0.7878056136279498
We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance.	0.9414469276306396
The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen.	0.667798048996159
This restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation, with no protection, forced to work on the black market, and to hide, while so-called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down.	0.9133976981625316
I must also tell you that in the year 2000, when there is so much talk about us, the coalition talks with the SPÖ failed - and unfortunately so - because the Socialist Party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme.	1.0777506035646576
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	0.23463895726696515
In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid.	0.8121663131549388
Social problems will increase, interregional disparities will grow, and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest, areas where there are more people and, especially, more businesses.	1.0639618689586434
It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else.	0.9204211263754654
Disabled people have too often been left off the list.	0.5208671919628812
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level.	0.9098968782720552
The Commission must continue along these lines.	0.8903984475717612
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning.	1.0138412308000555
The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.	0.7154741325483113
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought, where the crops have failed, and where, in six months' time, we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands.	1.0693837041699328
This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn, is the lowest in the whole of Europe.	0.8568155588808711
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes.	0.6239486484836314
However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter.	0.9580380856077468
Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe.	0.7250456221174533
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas.	0.6654267630666509
Firstly, for the single market.	1.1809005311275176
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation.	0.9890882228535238
In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy.	0.9545935030480177
Sixthly and finally, we reaffirm that ETA' s terrorism and violence must end. ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion.	0.6545065725690036
I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us.	0.609491495841722
Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee?	1.2038476189634502
If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July.	1.095717454960667
Madam President, may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry.	0.5807430682824513
I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts, which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings.	0.7217370513892559
Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe.	0.7131760589084133
When projects are implemented, it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation.	0.8706818555359463
(Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee)	0.7275538626455393
The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision.	0.7027593008687683
It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year.	1.232128206170634
The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland.	0.9051432184383275
Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas.	0.9328128325297887
All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support.	0.7249676474335901
There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me.	0.699846337451854
But trying to take something positive from them, I hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance, fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the European Union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it, not at some indefinite moment in the future, but here today.	0.796388102518617
People have the gall to say they benefit from the Lomé Convention, but even looking at trading relations alone, the Lomé Convention has done nothing to protect those countries; their already feeble share in trade with Europe has been halved.	0.848953481243509
Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence.	0.8760007500695268
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.	0.9498839016421147
I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union.	1.1930902629191749
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule.	1.0993307806524595
We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals.	1.0135066155776913
Among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting-up of the Euro Just project.	0.9146125207607279
This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer.	0.8845715711741085
- (DE) Mr President, the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper European financial area, which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency, but also to increase competition.	0.9089945342444983
When it is, then, still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes, the question of legitimacy arises.	0.8979373585188853
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin.	0.5963894347444049
Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period?	0.8495140558761854
However, if some of the amendments are accepted, particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group, we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document, lacking in rigour and, in that event, we would reconsider our support.	1.25022707851307
To that extent, it might be thought desirable, even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity.	1.242119542236743
I would like to answer these two questions as follows.	0.6185347900609487
Faced with these, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead.	0.8793440666408028
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this, just as you yourselves do.	0.674295525258083
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated.	0.5443008187114665
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility, the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible.	0.7401674583728891
In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.	0.9063986762752776
Although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned, government officials must be involved at decision-making level, whether they come from the municipalities, departments, regions or national governments.	0.875127586210166
The medicine may not taste too good in the short term, but opening one' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term.	0.8176817648841281
Thirdly, the European Parliament - through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries.	0.9759682385920296
The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible.	0.8740256651033318
The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible.	0.8184592549161546
In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme.	0.9374982892989727
We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water, as well as for reducing greenhouse gases, they should be adopted.	0.7916531463661477
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years (2000-2004).	0.8659424486571491
In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.	0.8216855039842734
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement, and puts the whole directive at risk.	0.7087924013807557
However, for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance, freedom of movement is still highly restricted.	0.9290792557007408
They are like a snake biting its own tail.	0.34874759251443865
We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations.	0.8057333842486949
In this respect, one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, the structurally planned cooperation between government, trade unions and employers' organisations.	0.8390268049849721
Thank you for your statement.	0.5103455855754806
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	0.6777486331103721
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances.	0.4853010214813086
I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course.	0.8981562064972326
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively.	0.6180014688147909
It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement.	0.9078408932996589
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.	1.056177779630763
However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium.	0.6628958138654205
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.	1.2634188211007067
I come from a country which manufactures 50% of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable.	1.0065138584511786
I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.	1.276477185881569
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers' liability.	1.095703267793912
There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources.	1.0632011144845417
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market.	0.614622613900161
The recent dioxin scare in Belgium, prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain, and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods, have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat.	0.9255934375355717
Between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets. In three or four days, this can equal the total figure of annual global production, or global GDP, of approximately EUR 6 000 billion.	0.953981616675599
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way.	0.7019601396417304
There are different views on this.	0.5766631101541118
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements.	0.9310286343945495
Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union, where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures.	0.6150387352538229
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.	0.796795514166684
Between 1994 and 1999, our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006.	0.6822819958081576
I have, however, taken note, particularly with regard to the most remote regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Nogueira Román too, that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.	1.1796299087852748
This Parliament' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties, making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes.	0.8963137374747514
This solution would not, in our opinion, be a fair one and indeed the Commission would have no irrefutable figures to support it.	1.0252614690045052
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document?	1.0063944246371486
To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years.	0.7803649858996586
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum.	0.8292049319283635
It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria.	0.8621048931012729
In sport the saying goes, "Do not change a winning team."	0.7218241779104086
For who can believe for one moment that private firms, motivated only by profit, will continue to provide services in high-cost areas unless the costs are borne by the already disadvantaged inhabitants who are not, therefore, in a position to take advantage of the service.	0.7483485328027397
This does not follow automatically: often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry, without this being matched by an increase in employment.	0.7875580658216722
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis.	0.6618033706484213
They already existed in ancient times: they had them in Roman times, although on a smaller scale.	0.6878397242509188
But the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107.	0.5549227103653338
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.	0.7864015258174754
I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole.	1.036465797989877
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events, which in the past seemed to be the norm.	1.1779486532907646
The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council.	0.9155064406730913
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference, if the Portuguese Presidency firstly, and then the French Presidency, so wish, in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement.	1.117298022439297
It is clear, of course, that in many ways the really hard work starts now, with the implementation of our proposals.	1.1906954923987592
Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago.	1.3050038626811742
I just want to emphasise this further.	0.6410445390960369
First, perhaps, I should say something on the question of the legal base.	1.169851915100162
Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries, to the point of collapse, as in Asia, Russia and Brazil.	0.9444114696337068
Mr President, I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development.	0.7115537697159082
I should like to be absolutely categorical.	0.9043070047070088
This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes.	0.8734986373231858
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments.	0.6342518580299165
We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things.	0.5695177506966043
I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen, but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course.	1.0090099463992948
Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer.	0.9900430306956596
If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high.	1.078237517095423
Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	1.0844507659218188
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.	1.2158086482932653
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today's session.	0.7066940768025873
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.	1.1994198997942078
However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit.	0.8861042641048141
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements ... declared universally applicable' (cf. Article 3(1)) are concerned, given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?	0.815309170243869
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition.	0.7667518479621994
We have to remedy that.	0.8404689240923922
Therefore, I do not believe I need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas, factors which are on the agenda, and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect.	0.9363222623431449
There must also be savings.	0.6799312961005946
This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent.	0.6025686205191909
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting, which is an extremely urgent matter.	1.1021638745941122
The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity.	1.1209840886249358

The challenges are different.	0.3752690232439449
Collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens, without any specialist knowledge, have invested their life savings.	0.6784623977939664
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s credibility on environmental issues.	1.078111396612087
Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union.	1.025979273018954
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million.	0.6123998763734795
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose.	0.8597754659345811
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement.	1.1072943922351621
The Commission expects Member States to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming.	0.6524120348738267
Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only.	1.2087995369334765
The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States?	0.7066282954432535
Finally, as regards the Council' s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery.	1.1497170815642745
Mr President, Commissioner, I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims.	0.7925003843383505
We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage.	0.8655940279547882
Cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing, the aim being to define best practice.	0.9967591276238452
Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol.	0.8944089679957813
We need to match this vision with reality.	0.6051179059555265
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from?	0.6485636602581721
Second, there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism.	0.7729227028351191
General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation.	0.5156543284189663
This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity.	0.9570164188357966
But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether.	0.6519855476867467
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue, for it makes things a little more interesting.	0.918513802523336
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this.	0.850561648618069
Here in this House, in Spain and in many other countries, we have all fixed on El Ejido. Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening, not only in El Ejido, but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment.	1.0019240071524487
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers.	0.677549708311977
I am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA, ELDR and PSE Groups.	0.9167032662014895
In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities.	0.9039963814941198
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally, which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive, which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council.	1.0196893884527891
I would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.	1.083317983526476
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children.	0.6911465843602177
In any event, the outcome is in your hands.	0.7741780205147688
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.	0.9273221489679766
As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture, one of the programme' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the Council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action: the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this.	0.9720898827888501
I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required.	1.1277133644699313
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference.	1.0899347885531032
It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth.	0.9242123563679405
However, in Spain and the other southern countries, which have an unusual climate, the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures.	1.03744243193498
For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33% or even 35% in one' s own country.	1.0677960570454295
I can hardly wait, Commissioner Byrne, to hear what you have to say to our proposals.	1.264373897637078
If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case -, but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly, precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law.	1.127835950329463
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.	0.6423518798035077
Not that I want to put it off, but it would be a gesture, as it were, if you could say: here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test.	1.2937429842956139
Of the EUR 1 919 million requested, only EUR 784 million have been granted.	0.7433166050689151
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.	0.7360290964223715
Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle.	1.1449281665071331
But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility.	0.8236160975436994
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.	0.8762088402667296
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up.	1.115197551694754
Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these.	0.7820386774216881
This event must underpin enlargement.	0.37214176390080433
Seattle was a failure, and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.	0.8755151755447492
The Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April.	0.9331787051741237
We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers.	0.5710652769764464
We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it, and there is no excuse for not taking action.	1.0028134017807293
This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria' s integration process.	0.915471460309887
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	0.7159782477694776
However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention.	0.7225657243975866
One or two years ago, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lööw which is extremely important in this context.	1.0582242129961703
In a debate, there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said.	1.1080786565364347
We will then see, at ministerial level, how we can follow this up.	0.9018522219202731
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility.	0.8870330638859301
I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately.	0.8900912192944862
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests.	1.0591814381041635
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006.	0.47785752291071837

At the moment, the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem.	0.8671581141113249
It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend.	0.9983549902832809
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are, of course, basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised.	0.8813484506688523
At the same time, it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms, and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union, in the wake of the establishment of the internal market, the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy.	1.0682613765489926
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded.	0.8080652055798354
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.	1.0254744339033441

We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States, as suggested in recital of the report.	1.0165715821655077
According to my group, this is excellent if, as a result of this, deprivation within regions, towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved.	0.8116188912560278
This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image, and this is a fact, not a judgement.	1.0792113827669083
For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that "the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States' social security systems" .	0.919605518516397
With regard to the discussion concerning the deadline, I want to say that the final date for beginning to implement LIFE - 31 March 2000, as set in the common position - must now be moved forward.	0.9608424847926271
In order to do so, it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various Member States, to set up a coordinating body to implement a 'Women and Science' monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women' s participation in research activities.	0.8671634959638831
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.	0.5491143963973699
As for the remaining vehicles, we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs, as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange, the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries, and we should therefore support them.	1.1710176838396977
We are not talking about words here.	0.6548813591108118
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out.	0.6047570848337791
It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the European cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities.	0.5793498469188163
Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided.	0.8759314555865618

This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well.	1.0553286309295082
Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness.	1.0274410085711927
The Parliament, the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda.	1.3774576422485207

This is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a NATO context, but, as the European Union shares NATO' s view of these issues, it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this. I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt.	1.068366438341057
It is up to Washington, not us, to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests.	0.7849330450555317
Instead, communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems, using EU resources as a value added to local actions.	0.710985016864299

Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle.	1.180323740707395
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation.	0.93863583866637

Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas?	0.8996063864110686

Lastly, I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us.	0.9190065074225221
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families.	1.0125562860005042
I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model.	0.9939950046258239

"He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."	0.7952681179104423

In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe, I am in favour of not making competition unequal but, in terms of environmental protection, I want freedom from costs for the last owner, to be financed by a special fund, and manufacturer responsibility for new cars, which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars!	1.0415628034918685
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function.	0.8671496900307931
If we continue down this path, and this is the ideology, and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy, then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions.	0.9762957867164139
The second area is that of freedom: freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union; freedom of information; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals.	0.9941970826478396
I will monitor this situation very closely. If necessary, within and pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation, I will make comments on the use made, not of Structural Funds which are not yet committed, but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these Structural Funds.	1.2495106284147899

In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.	1.0402197798983606
The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these.	1.0049870917467505
We must use dialogue at every political level, including of course dialogue with the national parliaments.	0.9723681418578523
And, because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission, let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre, be they remote regions, island regions or, of course, the most remote regions which are, naturally, the most distant.	0.9700828464230214
Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though, as was made clear in the Committee on the Environment, we would prefer LIFE to have been monitored by an advisory committee, we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the Council to be accepted as quite frankly, it was worse.	1.1555886850085488
Agenda	-0.0
Talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned.	0.7232127382491986
Secondly, we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused.	1.0927172876644318
This therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products.	0.9009704687093129
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy.	0.7771608648969066
The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history.	0.7635639303321315
The increase in the number of CFI judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere decoys, grudgingly granted, which we have become aware of after the fact.	0.6438374915536988
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.	0.6954643955330353
First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck.	0.8980767900915636
Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice.	0.8635831491806653

We share the view, forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts, and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures.	0.9645913048911543
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.	0.6893686753069952
I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked.	1.007540584027848
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative, whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	0.9067398871209156
If Europe has any meaning, and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning, if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning, then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and, whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again, must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation.	0.8881043887607334

I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety, public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission's work programme for 2000.	0.9814092694961832
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler, and given that we have heard contradictory comments, depending on the translation, with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler, I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House.	1.0883448259363098

Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases, specifically restricted to organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking.	0.7503650039840501

We have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive, in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the Commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms.	1.167959334676817
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.	1.0343215853776966
However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set.	1.0667387365956302
Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage.	0.807859158483669
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well.	0.9496762115083254
I hope that honourable Members will realise that, regardless of the more or less emotional statements made about issues of this kind, the day-to-day reality of international negotiations normally forces governments to adopt a somewhat more flexible stance - and when I say governments I mean all governments.	0.7877948557525033
Liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra ITL 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled.	0.7328777873367642
This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.	1.0254254775432197
Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts.	0.9286917428776594

We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control.	0.7304378329969847

Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.	1.0228764915316304
I thank the Commissioner, and do not at all question his intentions and interventions, which adopted a positive line.	1.0276026354589256

INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006, and is the one with the largest budget for implementation, i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time.	0.766734886814112
There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police.	0.9347789636602734
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion.	0.46178471708477875

The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council?	1.079699674291167
Mr President, co-operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market Europe, but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation: the fundamental human rights and freedoms, laid down in the European Convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.	0.9344275296588931

If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity.	0.9359245612400624

We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful.	1.3443378273577027
As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries.	0.9387471771222403
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.	1.2612724838424847
Regarding sustainability indicators, the European Environment Agency is already working with the Commission on the issue.	1.1004545508945003
Moreover, only minimal amounts were made available to us: we should bear in mind that the Commission communication indicated amounts totalling EUR 4 700 000 000 over the last five years, which corresponds to the cost of building 400 kilometres of motorway.	0.9575023949111225
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.	0.7810968254990185

Women belong to different social classes.	0.32633179358922937
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.	0.9451744383912863
The European Parliament' s opinion on the activities of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly has always had a major impact, undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the European Union in development and cooperation.	1.043530813665522
As I have said, we are not opposed to such a study.	1.0031968783572467
Accordingly, the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance.	0.8736337607730306
If, for any reason, the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else, if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude, they will be making a tragic mistake.	0.9651542826441543
I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law.	0.9518303586411967
Mr President, I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home.	0.7988614311684357
But, despite the unfavourable opinion of ten European postal services, a form of unacknowledged privatisation is brewing in the corridors of the Commission.	0.7364822064272017
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect.	1.050302283247288

Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today, I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken.	1.092428996584493
We back the rapporteur' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions.	0.9726826758413186

This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo.	0.7887575796669826
But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own; the Presidency of the Council must take action, the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves.	1.0615261266099896
The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases.	0.6118816875889301
I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures.	0.7235476994316099

If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis, and only in Denmark, then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark.	1.0447527267944035
We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	0.7385085101847183
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2, which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas, particularly on maritime borders.	1.1122356360942942
How is this to be done when, at the same time, the Commission' s proposal - which has been leaked, so the general public is aware of it - says that employees' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents, reports, drafts etc?	1.0166821722102035
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that.	0.5530935991505523
The Commission gives no soul to Europe.	0.3554577167327269
This sounds perfectly feasible. We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour, considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld' s report.	0.8979982562454989

I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa.	0.9773036668907402
For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters.	1.0356123733179
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report.	0.8861841525986143
It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands.	1.0597567087383544
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue.	0.9290189163226575
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine' s day. In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda.	0.9502955936813435
In waging war against people who are as poor as they are, they are only doing their own exploiters a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves.	0.6143482000174793

By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases.	0.708809944364003
Mr President, I voted for the Procacci report on rural development, not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LEADER programme, but also because it complements the URBAN programme, which I spoke about earlier.	1.0246681674438032
I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything.	0.7643971752793305
We are all entitled to clean drinking water.	0.7211995282333453

How is it envisaged that the EU' s institutions, which are already stretched well beyond their capacity, can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition?	0.9920482859254672
We shall address this problem and check all the translations.	0.6028821844674028
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance; it is just about the following question: when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive?	0.8923650951418561

I believe that this issue is relevant to my question.

Thus, while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend, we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed.	1.0477236557338991
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another.	0.34719023863374476
Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment.	1.046212865409151

The conclusions of the Tampere special European Council, as Mr Hernandez Mollar said, clearly illustrated the will of the Heads of State and Government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based, with particular emphasis on the Union' s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants.	1.0011951407710162
I hope for their adoption.	0.46417897232792155
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets.	0.845299206453735
The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes.	1.2553077065539067

We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance.	0.7321626747597654
I have a related point.	0.7942491988753307
I could not conclude without mentioning Mr Van Hecke' s speech in particular, in which he referred to the human rights situation in Africa and to the role and priorities of the Portuguese Presidency, and questioned the sincerity of the priority we are giving to relations with the European Union.	1.0697554388318269
That is why, when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993, and 1994 and 1999, we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.	1.2520259408165897

Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency.	1.1238105448538915
That is a point that deserves serious consideration.	0.7992248482455062

One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion. The second is to create internationally competitive conditions, which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union, and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion.	1.0528199716334459
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.	1.0391199722044921
As matters stand, Turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of Cyprus being integrated into the European Union, and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the Greek community whilst the Turkish community, whose level of prosperity is already far lower, would fall even further behind.	1.0087213389909384

Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday.	0.9282244532400336
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used.	0.8446743814832008
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks.	0.6718415491867682
We expect the Commission to implement it.	0.7734997930842561
Therefore, according to proponents, such as Mr Désir, an internationally applied Tobin tax would, in principle, reduce speculative transactions and, hence, the volatility of exchange rates, which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity.	0.9637494933098356

With regard to the events of recent days, I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day, and the week, that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which, given what we have said about the Austrian crisis, I believe should be fully included in the Treaties.	1.2498781122515177
Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time.	1.053992694172829

Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries.	1.081187113569829
Mr President, the question at issue is the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish Government says that it must cover health costs, then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves, with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal.	0.8423953995188953

It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised, high-level training of safety advisers, but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training, with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates.	1.0419604185589995
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean' s geographical peculiarities, which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions.	0.8482545030488943
I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members, because I do not think that these add anything to the report.	1.061039731145122
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.	0.4134535906563579
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand, within the context of the new agreement, that working methods should be developed and optimised.	1.1370378876961824

More supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally, for example by means of the IMF.	1.0585154276728344
Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade.	0.9127745449355633
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in Parliament, but the URBAN programme is one of the best examples of our work: it was created following an initiative in Parliament.	0.9324064713976923
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.	0.6145564660714217
In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources.	0.7535105879745048
Mr President, I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer. I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians.	0.961357856558601
For it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one.	0.8040258429082245
It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions.	1.1796286638524935
Mr President, Commissioner, as my time is limited, I shall get straight to the point.	1.2362678880891864
We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history.	0.9113325989945081
We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg of tourism.	0.5439164579804355
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens.	0.7499606163531163
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.	0.8226366806127252
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year.	0.7434157300360121
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society.	0.3902006587025658
Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced.	1.0667416333235145
Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention.	0.7571355087807201
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south, particularly the countries around the Mediterranean, must not be abandoned.	0.9461065148696358
Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system.	0.9018080140468553
Like my own country, Sweden, the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of every human.	0.8315967193346575
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers.	0.8091311542399844
It is something that we can all support.	1.1099445121614422
Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions.	0.980925752154448
With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position.	0.9373649521714293
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics.	1.1773951468362727
There is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding Angola.	0.5738409590369139
What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this.	0.9522877866109695
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow.	0.6558013736176164
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured.	1.018948276096624
Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure.	0.7413844205506853
The Commission' s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, which we have debated this week, contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject, except the reminder, in a single line, that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 January 2002.	0.9479468104422824
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.	0.8055132140104629
Mr President, over the years, the following situation has arisen: one subject has developed into a subject of many facets.	0.8270821610942034
We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year.	0.9739087648302672
Please, Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your promises.	0.7574739944806048
Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.	1.0107091880474186
However, as Parliament, we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies, which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves.	1.0949020534872274
If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.	0.90153694046791
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation.	0.47101188203409466
Mr President, the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis.	0.9818082614609693
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.	0.7133815988224609
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.	1.1176080646738697
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.	1.1736984465376434
The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches.	0.7202874492226057
Firstly, there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets.	0.8026000958277357
I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure.	1.1071688110804863

I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero, or close to zero, degree of pollution.	0.9231003853046966
This is a moral interest, a safety interest and is, ultimately, even in the interest of our economy.	1.0739922090440353
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally.	0.9484009305049118

The Austrian elections were held in a free, proper and democratic manner.	0.6093296846194179
But I did notice a drop in alertness and when we debated the amendments of our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, you mentioned the Greens on their own in every instance.	0.8252056888593444
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6102068021528617
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.	0.9490073243196817
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement.	0.628961033313613
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report.	0.8680042284343962
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts!	0.8641468978456393
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.	0.9558736606806413
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament' s corresponding powers in this area.	0.8318906336940094
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition.	0.6294250249287449
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza, the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank, further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments.	0.8258223889453833
It contrasts Prime Minister Barak' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude, even physical absence, of the strong man of Damascus, President Assad, at the negotiations in the United States.	0.8723997528171462
For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.	0.8275550740950625
We also face difficulties with regard to offences.	0.5133420958355318

I sincerely hope that, in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East, all the key protagonists will move forward quickly, in the very near future, so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved.	0.9398477012490996

One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative.	0.712348608169984
For me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in China - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this?	1.1653780350488037
the report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta [COM(1999)0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)].	0.7419208191034311
Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds?	0.7050899965062646
Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism and European separatism.	0.6204898006610073
This is why it is essential, as a matter of urgency, for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes.	0.9712722827347442
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises.	0.7679709188680802
What did I understand on reading the related texts?	0.4877765185813037
Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible.	0.9195424537848
What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up?	0.8816829760415044
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened.	0.9309359581492175
Mr President, let us be clear from the outset: when it comes to cooperation, coherence is far from being the watchword.	1.067642521696919
But I want to add a word of caution.	0.7603981539546014
Mr President, I am grateful for the Council' s oral, and also written, reply.	1.2186960991619171
. (FR) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate.	0.7178687412083031
We cannot be accused of bad management.	0.5257429828431304
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog.	0.8192500671530035
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Representatives of the Commission, it is a black day for Austria and for Europe.	0.7673335561750403
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise.	0.5478897095656581
Finally, during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries.	0.603690123394418
As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	1.0281011602093237
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union.	0.981405946960097
If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent.	0.9951718670553698
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met?	0.8907721356874245
As recognised in the report, which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks, we accept that the directive contains some loopholes.	1.2183707718138068
In our opinion, it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament, in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena, have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period.	0.8321858867564199
Let me turn to some of the more important points.	0.8108855254378713
I am not asking for details or specific points, but I believe that a mention was required.	0.8682637982923854
In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action.	0.9632049552542643
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries?	1.0882221029842607
If it is a personal statement, would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate, at which stage I would be happy to call you?	1.0958142784740117
The debate is closed.	0.07888568388731058
If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up.	1.1252784577253487
We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system.	1.0280180495920264
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.	1.1378936543075635
Mr President, first of all, we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water, but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia, aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded, have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too, making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous.	0.871002125080155
The vessel is anchored outside the port, as the condition it is in is a safety hazard for the port and the surrounding areas, and because it cannot be inspected properly, as there is no one who will pay.	1.0534224817426217
We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view.	0.9937878391848778
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones.	0.9305699706738558
For this very reason, we cannot agree to cut pensions further.	0.9446095128372792
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information.	0.8651053504694854
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there.	0.9615486091477505
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.	0.8749551887874445
It is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which, when all said and done, will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process.	1.0709061691622785
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.	0.39711046462729666
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success.	0.7998619066098949
But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation.	1.0087511553975756
As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs.	0.7822155349544551

I would like Mr Barón Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it. That is, if he so wishes, of course.	1.2345258967581452
The message contained in the joint text is still valid.	0.8155994964639242
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.	0.690631801929146
In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gasòliba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years.	1.0673502061972
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu, but with more unsatisfactory implications, restricting the Commission, so you say, to the task of drawing up a few White Papers, as you proposed.	1.2606544757023188
And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.	0.9506028840453529
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.	0.7428805045158514
Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.	0.6998648513877077
Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido.	0.8947994351001441
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court, but it does not yet exist.	1.2193183555480873
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step.	0.895125497570644
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure.	0.9079157457598019
However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments.	0.869305578641453
We need to do something about it.	1.0577013013775682
Equality has no pillar of its own.	0.5841200662661794
Against that background, our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, as adopted in committee.	1.1062319657346817
Commissioner, we must be consistent.	1.3413707358809412
Is the Council discussing this issue?	0.768313013605079
Finally, of course, the Cyprus question has a role in the discussions with Turkey.	0.9861746302124051
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.	0.6010429071457585
Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals.	1.0377694089938785
Mr Prodi, I repeat that this is, in our opinion, a slightly short-sighted view.	1.2935790743382691
In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.	0.972030533032734
I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May.	1.0005993794362953
I therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile.	0.9722923856129875
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect.	0.6801652772158099
The operation of the Community Support Framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state, government and party delirium as regards the European Union' s funding.	0.9114025569491673
Firstly, the idea of an EU passport for management companies is to be welcomed; and the home-state approval rule is also to be welcomed.	1.1398247634819532
The second sentence should read: '.., weshalb diese Hilfen' (which is why we have this aid), then 'ohne Bedingungen und' (unconditionally and) should be deleted, and it continues as follows: 'ohne Abhängigkeit von reziproken Anweisungen von seiten des Geberlandes gewährt werden müssen' . (and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries).	0.9824631502128904
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase.	0.7595556663408857
My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy, programme and tone of Austria' s Freedom Party.	0.487776897447254
Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe.	0.8155026161473551
We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid.	0.6445783392964073
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.	1.038406710580331
As a result, speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets, causing growing economic instability which, in turn, jeopardises the entire economy.	0.6983437662210998
First let me speak about the economy and social development.	0.866751502087457
For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable.	0.8844517401830413
The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well.	1.070952541036063
So, once again, why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest, valued in France, by Senator Larcher, as it happens, at FF 8 billion?	1.015002911067148
In that context I would mention the following: social rights, workers' rights, quality of work, the need to ensure respect, where necessary, for all the criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation, the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minorities are entitled, particularly within the European Union.	1.1103360237234048
In our view, cooperation is, and should remain, an intergovernmental exercise.	1.121918279474
Since no one wishes to speak, I shall put this proposal to the vote.	1.0270931783796624
The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement.	0.6008653835434176
Both documents, that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft, cover largely the same ground.	0.977488729667199
In my view, and I say this quite clearly, the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused.	1.1312310528330376
May I just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and misapplied with regard to the equal treatment of self-employed people, including assistant spouses.	0.8491645217684937
But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.	0.792493045316171
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation.	0.8134371903747204
Madam President, Mr Prodi, you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element: confidence.	0.7773561469599313
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas.	0.7424061374273577
This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds).	0.9554144738093404
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'.	0.7816674947116831
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi.	0.9460551235750136
Words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country's respect for and adherence to human rights.	0.504194729360235
Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less.	0.8669202862222075
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions, by protecting the Union' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community' s economic life.	0.8914742112847097
In view of the humanitarian aid being given by the European Union and the efforts being made by the head of the interim administration, Mr Bernard Kouchner, what measures will the Council take to defend the rights of the women of Kosovo to motherhood and to protect the health of pregnant women, women in confinement and new-born children?	0.8979809048012344
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.	0.9570409666454347
It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace.	1.0215424720010338
Well, that depends on who the legislators are.	0.7376213686373123
What of the human rights of the millions of French people who voted for the National Front and who are deprived of any political representation and vilified daily, as they were on Monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes, when the simple expression of justifiably exasperated views by one of our colleagues, Mr Le Pen, is used as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation, in violation of the law and in violation of all notions of justice, fairness and morals, and when attempts are made, in violation of the clearest legislation, to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote, not received as a favour from the government.	1.073675897293936
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.	0.8595887051542905
This is important.	0.7012054829626954
With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that 'The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States.	1.008886195595632
Furthermore, they have taken on the task of creating a "scoreboard" to verify the progress made in this area at Community level, but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States.	1.1357641027951746
A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand.	0.883933455488362
An association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the European Parliament and the Czech Parliament.	1.048810461250858
In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable.	0.751078526960207
We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it.	0.8737725686057797
We condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do, but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse.	1.0951158688124594
What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up?	1.2745835701251287
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references.	0.68133641593884
That is the goal which we have to work towards.	1.2389787850478697
. Mr President, industrial change, which can be gradual or sudden, is driven by new technologies, worldwide competition or consumer preferences.	0.9508237273011164
Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.	0.8114725304083352
Consequently, we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom.	0.9011991454389319
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.	0.7037025379196122
We are left with Article 11(1) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States.	0.6391472103627984
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive.	1.1764349274186503
But what were the Commission' s arguments, from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular, for eliminating the URBAN programme?	0.8114458854383249
We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other.	0.8934140493305878
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes.	0.5939352687661481
He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not.	1.0141276318098351
This resolution of 14 January 1999 required that, prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector, involving 1.7 million employees after all, the Commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation.	0.8374002484237892
Mr President, I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly, Mr Corrie. It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly.	1.077075952035578
This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive.	0.6629393005327591
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately.	0.7996606433927274
Finland' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces.	0.9703532728641073
Finally, if the Treaty needs to be amended, how do you think this amendment will be implemented, following the report to be submitted in Feira? How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting?	1.0829927857803407
Still on judicial cooperation, considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro, and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance.	1.0123093787191384
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.	0.864996071397219
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency.	0.8462772360464669

We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly.	0.5420956511202953
It has been a useful debate.	0.9528224550770256
For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law.	1.0330639272632505
That is my first question.	1.0969193028172253
In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families shattered.	0.9941097586962075

One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe. This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard.	1.0445251802795756
As far as this is concerned, the report, albeit a component, may well be the key component of Lisbon, because it is really innovative, while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before.	1.1327954734205736
The debate is closed.	0.0698193781730895
During the Finnish presidential term, a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process, and, on the basis of this report, I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making.	1.1836305964685643
Today, we have been called on to choose, for the forthcoming decades, between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy, but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring.	1.0382578572685497
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?	0.685993971583316
However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol' s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities.	0.9883235431891266
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.	0.7914136903297482
According to media reports the Portuguese Presidency considers that all Members should pay the same tax, to the EU. This is in conflict with the view taken by some Member States who wish to have the right to tax their Members in their home countries.	1.0605500017873501
The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention, so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area, and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose.	1.101067487102259
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions, we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.	1.0382195583991598
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.	1.001126101608923
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions.	0.833676888341861
The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration.	0.980267352182129
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken, which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues.	1.3938554565819603
Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban.	0.534304711431565

In the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem, but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean.

This is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis.	1.0184675484754269
They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment.	0.8656868180599023
In this sense, I share Commissioner Patten' s positive attitude.	0.9297340746003202
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force.	0.9144447613974033
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts	0.5434100146526438
Mr President, "Europe stands for ideals, values and principles.	0.6957604631682525
It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today.	0.8457300089318555
And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the "contre-filet" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned.	0.9153042915607937
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions.	0.5062855756232931
Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised?	0.4335716108499431
We will want to share with Parliament, as vicars say, our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead.	0.8880147656340125
In the twentieth century, we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk, and morality, values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name: nationalist glorification, populism and the concept of racial superiority.	0.7859326546624608
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.	1.0335357602254607
That brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the European Council in Tampere.	0.9638608161867039
We had heard about this regrettable incident.	0.48414291831682843
In this House, in the past, large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission, under its power of initiative, launched, not as experiments, but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress, but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union.	1.1407906733825623
Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products.	0.8525838879861461
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes.	0.9115493699297859
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it, we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament, the social partners and non-governmental organisations.	0.9116788545228489
Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow.	0.7336793434470615
And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs.	1.1064687677457266
In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community. This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination.	1.1244523503601094
The other concerns the collective investment undertakings.	0.536868109198217
Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved.	1.0967969372485311
With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition' s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights.	1.1803850694756426
What I hope is, first, that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, that we will not allow some to be picked off, that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence, that it will be a common position and a sensible position.	1.30664372656442
Andersson report (A5-0033/2000)	0.2781870179925608
On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well.	0.8350629535381712
And finally, there are the cross-border aspects. I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.	1.034464274074138
The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money.	0.6780433702043558
The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin.	0.9362833003486187
We will try to address them, but it is not easy.	0.9910340580496669
In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve.	0.9779607181000886
I acknowledge Mr Patten' s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO.	0.8349081197334813
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised.	0.9700287511524699
Now to the technical aspect. The safety factor in this type of project, and I am speaking as an engineer, has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty.	0.9052315772125687
We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.	0.8221304784625914
The solution to the Cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to Cyprus' s accession to the Union, as Mr Poos has reminded us.	0.8484890569319746
However, we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government.	0.9337494510596145
The examples are, I hope, all well known. In any case, they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products.	0.8948908454320207
The report seeks "effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" , without going on to define more specifically what this means.	0.6713773196583076
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.	0.9475148187087344
Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide.	0.9076027011688076
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000.	0.6700438053022302
Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters.	0.536792017835744
Thirdly, we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive.	1.104574123648156
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities, so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.	0.8727397132907904
On the other hand, it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament, which were minimal anyway.	1.002358481138578
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters.	0.8830224235034272
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission' s social programme.	0.5529682918672314
Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal.	0.8429624643226725
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest.	0.8507549181101587
This is a task that has lasted three years, and on which we have been consulted, so to speak, as a matter of course, when this issue, as has already been stressed, comprises highly important formal and substantive facets, which called for a range of assessments, consultations, concerted actions and codecisions.	1.0555803195319622
We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe?	0.9330088288338845
It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives.	1.1182608292675071
However, the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the European Union wishes to pursue with this text.	1.1339349964004322
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions.	0.7342740453062082
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.	0.6812916080833458
This constitutes a good example, therefore.	1.1036818991471127
All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule.	0.9272023783763423
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission' s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components.	0.5443957617632307
We call on everyone, within and outside Kosovo, to support these common aims, to support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to achieve them.	1.0455611701103344
Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months.	1.0453941590430575
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe.	0.7430259589298999
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action.	1.0315252730154896
The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion.	0.5943028266691712
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.	0.7013756385927168
This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time.	0.8338255386479724
In fact, Article 86 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 90, stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them.	0.7485572844316739
We want to talk about coherence.	0.8657756709104008
I know that this directive may have problems, given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union, as has already been mentioned.	1.1474166462691355
They are wrong.	0.4366495291068061
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.	0.8404696739481494
So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home.	0.8665979458030133
I wish you a good evening.	0.6210543687017096
On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.	1.2130678344135488
The committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented, and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence.	0.961314515539038
It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in May and this Parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom, security and justice.	0.9126961792909581
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making.	1.3219389814456386
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries.	0.721096158658878
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true! "I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999".	1.0776173359741752
The first country is Indonesia.	0.29814572541262985
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development, that is to say unit managers and more senior managers, have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised.	0.9067210203735376
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.	0.9564726647347831
And, when we recall that, like many others on all sides of this House, my and my colleagues' instincts are naturally aroused.	1.07704568959737
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms.	0.852395166946485
Question No 1 by (H-0780/99):	0.2262863459220502
We of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you.	0.5298975746572805
Secondly, the financial contributions.	1.158921178034521
We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call "hard law" .	0.7469755777032884
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	0.842690635958037
However, we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms, we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health.	0.9849165994484212
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, which was condemned by the court, to the post of European Commissioner.	0.855622194915689
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours.	1.0598926029255822
To them I just want to say, as the English expression goes, 'You can' t have it all.'	0.7822230027596471
There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House, for example, about something which should be good news: the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework.	0.8912338709222916
There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership.	0.9298062136211023
He has done really good work in a very short time.	0.872957924795424
Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues.	1.1680416846687538
We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission.	0.8634149651798988
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet.	0.6355604850168654
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.	0.5157103926138243
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.	0.6451176233907109
The time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase, namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis, although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed.	1.1416851477998646
However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies?	0.9858472056443723
I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States.	1.0125713738418136
Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR, in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero?	0.8508966264799984
I saw Member States working as a team, which was indeed a wonderful experience.	0.8458092309392405
It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries.	0.8745613791530327

There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge.	0.5955324321269719
However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.	0.93797081586031
However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya.	1.1179538793817136
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.	0.6715121029338618
We would, in this way, violate democracy.	0.8026467976616547
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that, in fact, a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000.	0.9970711687255973
That is also something which is allowed under present legislation. I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne' s question.	1.1027988179873809
I am sure that you will agree, Mr President, and experience has shown us, that the process of enlargement of the Union is not without its pitfalls for both parties and the Czech Republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria.	1.0537534599985947
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution, which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights.	0.8537834656111358
It is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors' need for protection and security.	0.6411169133136412
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and, against that background, find a compromise. That was not easy.	1.0176674366658838
This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service?	0.8345178779756031
As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament.	1.1637441853092603
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process.	1.1351717336046998
With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament' s reading of it.	0.9995565884845544
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval, through individual cases, which will take more than six or eight months to resolve, an excessively long period, which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility, affecting the generation of wealth and employment.	0.8358439975208914
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 February 2000.	0.6907798267764524
For this reason, I cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to European level.	0.9374406236016659
This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget.	0.5668565783952724
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.	1.1224582809436492
This discussion is not new.	0.30703554573758557
It is obviously the Commission' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want.	1.131352919466655
It need only be fine-tuned.	0.36204033193661345
This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs.	0.8620520511531218
First, and the Commissioner has also confirmed this, because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets.	1.1686275910498352
What we are doing here is not hypocritical.	0.7136253507402774
Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.	0.7782679249429156
I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service.	1.1052501521196691
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation.	0.7508111133736783
Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people.	0.9464191494125771
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.	1.0641818779974708
The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union, provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners.	0.6821897198746167
However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence.	0.7959056449139595
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service.	1.1130089939286019
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments.	0.7397560275567865
The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it.	0.9963868661875768
Amendments Nos 49, 50 and 51, which share the same basis, are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the Commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation, and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors.	1.0649276022238563
I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission.	0.9966006694836409
Finally, aid can enable restructuring, offer training, save jobs and thus know-how.	0.7344494423190382
I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks.	0.6564699403607057
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.	0.9344358691562324
After all, who protects these deeply corrupt regimes, if not the governments of the rich countries?	1.076352230787625
Firstly, an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and, in particular, in protecting certain sections of the civilian population. Secondly, an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on.	0.922605051719481
First of all, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains, as everyone knows, a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel' s commitments. This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements.	0.927657967577407
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament!	1.0667199592067171
The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough.	0.5309005437630798
On one hand, there are the words and, on the other, their real political meaning.	1.0175466973312264

Mr President, the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less- and least-developed countries, it is purely a rich country selfish interest.	0.7431862414799731
Under no circumstances can we, as responsible politicians, allow what is currently happening to continue, with young girls practically bought in the countries of the East and coming here to be abused on the cheap.	0.8848583245147
But we also need to be aware that it is by virtue of rational political stances, and flexibility in negotiations, that we are able to find solutions to the major disputes which have ultimately led to many tragedies in history.	1.0524478969448001
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation.	0.832310740570963
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer.	0.9704162012257547
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.	0.49570003480830893
Mr President, ever since Plato' s 'Republic' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts.	0.6600559766589779
I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible, you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation.	0.9319163304425893
It is, of course, the responsibility of policies, and therefore our responsibility, to guarantee the safety of sea transport.	0.9744549977411247
Tourism and employment	-0.0
No-one would benefit from this situation.	0.6287708273813295
In order to prevent this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism.	1.0084877815151392
We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial.	0.7724504987309708
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future.	1.1424833222211204
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission.	1.0159827999542952
This is why this report is also so politically charged: a report, by the way, on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly.	1.3649943226338972
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.	0.9567069494340669
OLAF, the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts, criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions.	0.9281669622084125
You may draw your own conclusions.	0.4143990607966409
Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources.	0.9374565424620982
The question is, furthermore, one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way.	0.8792449235225235
Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues.	1.009661038037817
The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention.	0.9707746382532243
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.	0.9459078640828942
Oil slick off the French coast	0.22276010632384413
Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing.	1.128713811143552
Mr President, the issue of social security systems is an important one.	1.1478105720284946
Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed?	0.550056514461825
But the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy, albeit not for every individual animal.	0.7374816418651811
Surely this cannot be the role of your, my and the citizens' tax money?	0.9905104743293354
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.	1.0346279452363696
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.	0.47763305436078834
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion, and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves, the judiciary, the Member States, and above all the SMEs concerned, that need to be clarified.	1.1572220502904906
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation' s introduction of the Plimsoll line, a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels.	0.653113019187168
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble!	0.48196257466319564
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.	1.1887947086872863
From our point of view, it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament.	0.7417590609605168
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree.	0.7244300216938271
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this.	1.0237516629824492
The main point is that the money for Cyprus' s and Malta' s pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for, if the Council does not endorse this view, it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in Helsinki in December.	1.0286856695211781
Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards.	0.8882691424685952
Madam President, I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.	0.7818570513382621
Third, standards in European public life must be upheld.	0.5585108920319483
I will set this out in five points.	0.5959041428675786
We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries. Parliament' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU.	0.7871263134036713
Such a rule is only normal.	0.4545125008927946
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision.	0.9483126730502601
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes.	0.834883600880084
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity.	0.8236551048175575
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.	0.9736344894472979
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends.	0.9037118549853017
According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply.	0.9655318096260884
In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.	1.0732906236811712
He has led efforts to end provision for Austria' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants.	0.5304658723388854
In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others.	1.2643290411150205
Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Barnier.	1.0024978151811672
The situation there is totally unacceptable.	0.6585192869039613
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union, in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring.	0.8253801680523158
Many of us here in this House have spent years, whether we intended to or not, dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail.	1.0348002766176474
The preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the European investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units.	0.643279324385714
I expect that Parliament's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive.	0.7897871356119974
It is the Cypriot Government, Mr President-in-Office, not the government of Nicosia.	1.1089502332961103
All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity, democracy and the rule of law.	0.6361294693650714
No, of course not.	1.0756998787342609
Now that the Commission has to consider carefully what resources are required for each activity, this is an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid: one that is inessential but demanding in terms of resources.	0.987133518040302
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.	0.8519335530566984
Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for.	0.9666490500570358
The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison.	0.7633668776910918
Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one. Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable.	0.9447501897929589
Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lomé Conventions.	0.6893400556255916
Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world.	1.181550741729983
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises. What we have here, first and foremost, is an incredibly ominous mixture of power, arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union.	1.037936035087527
This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly.	0.388013601664978
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.	0.9279526492372829
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down, the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups) have not, thank God, succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive, namely manufacturer responsibility.	1.0963664124274033
As the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter.	0.783708171499902
I shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment.	0.8677859530639266
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State.	0.7665061476462611
The outcome of the discussions, as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area, are now being examined by the Commission.	1.070352081016037
The overriding features of today' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups.	0.6519708606438293
For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4.	0.6572424977177009
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes.	0.5924814817345094
As you know, there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens.	0.7676758856313722
In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.	0.8956329586263692
Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days.	0.8478392667922231
I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted, this must be remedied.	0.8323722299078655
Tens of thousands of people are on the run.	0.780827589670521
In reaching an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party, the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success.	0.6748693564909962
I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.	0.9175869791843763
This seems to be a good thing and useful.	1.1540769606048205
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999.	0.5798613326575316
Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.	0.9473258320714997
Finally, I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons.	1.0165463535315746
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted.	1.0125709253017483
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality.	0.7601162785023509
Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings, the connection with BSE has still not been clarified, as I have already said.	0.987112872960973
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide.	0.7156948645945851
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns.	0.7748868132715153
Parliament has frequently made that point.	0.39200985793776155
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.	0.9848982345634016
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay.	0.6237326324961483
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.	0.7371044164958311
From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good.	1.2095572470902973
At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative.	0.839318656965809
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report, so they have to take responsibility.	0.9565808869094995
It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.	0.9993727591927218
But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.	0.9512440384664852
However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal.	1.0400257625065712
What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing.	0.6195621291050701
As regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms, it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the Community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers, interpreters and artists for reproduction, distribution and rental to the public, and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcasts.	0.8841881958064104
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.24067315726584518
I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained.	0.8618564457491075
Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.	0.9916904576581003
INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory.	0.8596382955550392
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs.	0.6496265927640753
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court.	0.9436016045226574
So what do we need to happen immediately?	0.712712239866217
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts.	0.8267907497080371
Who is going to pay?	0.5830789958197207
It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives.	0.6891233331337048
Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund, the EAGGF, this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas, an issue you are quite right to raise.	0.778010056498686
According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically.	0.9446026212830286
Take, for example, the pledges made by the Commission. They look good in themselves.	1.019565660445141
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture, to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services, and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life, diversification and job creation.	0.8909005513497843
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	0.8993919749863324
Mr Corbett set out Parliament' s concerns.	0.3993730431337329
One of the very first speakers, Mr Wuori, spoke of the remarks made earlier today by Mr Havel.	0.9905849152065264
I thank the Minister for his response, but I would also like to point out that, statistically, there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing.	1.0505457026977036
I have one last point to make, which is about the European Union' s responsibility and, specifically, in this case, about possible action by the Council in this matter, and the responsibility of the international community, which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo.	1.255634336037025
This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week, commenting on the Union' s development policy.	0.6406675115177811
If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation.	1.0086100258667008
But other countries, in other situations, may have alternative analyses.	1.0613431455778182
Just as elderly people in cities are very isolated, so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities: they are drawn by the bright lights, and the pubs, and the countryside and rural areas are being emptied.	0.9674073967358295
Agenda	-0.0
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century.	0.7982223134391159
But if we are to believe the environmental movements, even this is vain hope.	0.852518152974053
This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made, but it comes at a price: it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries, which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries, banks and public services, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go.	0.8957104453365549
. (DE) Madam President, I have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification, because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations.	0.9392688039774354
In the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner, will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women, women in childbirth and babies?	1.002049675217585
Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react.	1.1125168453819885
I know I can rely on everyone here.	0.42758810097850525
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level, the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community's legislation, covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.	0.9634313960733074
Hence, to my mind, that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty, which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition. The same applies to Article 105, in my view, for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty, of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment.	0.974651736808478
The principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied.	0.5247509121121898
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.	0.9814196164037154
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000.	0.666236163669383
Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us.	0.7068453267043229
Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	1.0235199598379048
We must incorporate the gender factor in science, research and all other European Union policies, in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market.	0.6384762194370376
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.	0.6981566862802635
The lion' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans: eleven restrictions and two improvements.	0.44468621434520406
Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear.	0.9820471503889066
I refer to Cuba' s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries.	1.0911086267825
It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface, ground, transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level.	1.0824554383616345
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all!	0.6491134698645582
The credibility of the industrialised north is at stake.	0.5288174556725875
It may be supposed, for example, as Commissioner Bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 September last year, that the Commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 grams and two and a half times the basic tariff.	0.7882681884802608
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur.	1.0574402059705217
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree.	0.47822171395752827
On the other hand, it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking, I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be buried.	1.1357922981908968
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita.	0.6970198797145488
We also notice that, according to the explanatory statement, modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements, either, and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back.	0.7888440624978841
(Applause)	-0.0
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine.	0.8019363791693477
Mr President, permit me to say quite publicly to Mrs Stenzel, who is a member of the ÖVP executive, that many MEPs are horrified that you have entered into a coalition with Haider, and that we wish to denounce you for doing so!	0.9211864967605545
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way.	0.9260783984246592

In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people.	0.8787345664637767
We welcome the efforts of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council.	1.3684297029436854
They have lost their status, and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.	1.0307444072705785

It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues.	1.1504881731468717
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schüssel.	0.5666271139241005
You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something.	1.236452326466192
The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not.	1.189556074335075
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.	0.9864673045041572
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that.	0.7566174446678133
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.	0.7743165610621688
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.	0.5422570991725189
We are also committed to the Security Council' s sanctions against UNITA, including arms controls.	0.9565660662815351
Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming.	0.4128146307867825
So, I say to the Council of Ministers: Keep this programme genuinely under review.	1.206701709585384
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act.	0.8200380885494858
Firstly, Mr President, although your two predecessors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency, it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of European construction.	0.9911147056388617
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action.	0.9968811745088735
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General.	0.9930645857305146
In fact, the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in Parliament.	0.8270592895608423
This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area.	1.1832279080803911
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many cars- did not have any problem with that.	1.00420995050505
So the Tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate.	0.7477273938054133
Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market.	0.9544022733030051
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy.	0.6389171221114979
The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted.	0.8675426992800774
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.	0.9109668148727655
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.	1.0021421787026137
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company.	1.10382655345298
This is why, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words, so that nobody, absolutely nobody, can use this message, which is unusual and unwise, to say the least, to contribute, and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace.	0.9391221015691007
It did not work; poverty became worse than ever.	0.6359890076855653
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways.	0.7691120605264801
In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition.	1.0466827145950461
The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community.	0.6522379454020557
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature.	0.8668813395709101
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy.	0.7479750274100496
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	0.7958421462589382
I hope we can have, in particular, debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters, where people are still being tortured, where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted, as I do.	0.9924067142609735
Madam President, we simply have a few translation problems in this area too.	0.9712381983694371
How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25%, as opposed to less than 5% in other countries?	0.8765001125842783

Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect.	0.8066856893345721
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters.	0.8379457049513979
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question, and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position.	1.016879535346264
Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues.	1.1357166082465626
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved.	0.7742674802302879
I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate.	1.0259081025940495

I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign?	1.1849660321733329
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc.	0.982280889029321
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it.	0.6372794782336124
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.	0.9621527298125802
Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful.	0.9657114123022699

Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez.	0.8291300799896161

I remain at your service in order, when the time comes, to present the report of previous planning which you request, but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning.	1.0009016346301536
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about.	1.0861055155064006
I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council, reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project, together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality, following a progressive strategy, within a time-frame of five years, and that, above all, the three components of this area should be in balance: freedom, security and justice.	0.8243214625211582

We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway.	0.6700468917387524

The importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data.	0.9164473613085966
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers" .	1.1226075005150795
Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them.	0.9321623859932753
Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents.	0.8586993712486343
We must implement what the directive insists on, that the postal service is available to everybody.	0.963478619327913
The Commission proposal is, as some of you have said, rather technical.	1.3229124459714563

For the Commission this requires that action in the tourism field must be tightly linked to measures promoting the take-up of information communication technology by the tourism industry, in particular by the innovation and innovative society technological programmes which are both within my competence.	0.9368686175580369
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.	0.9245917884245585
Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens.	0.8611653997684878
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid.	1.2448194578573404
However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government.	1.1476289742572139
If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result.	0.7600560068889062
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States.	1.0723180717535414
This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested.	1.2929117082853328
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union, for which the Commission is responsible.	1.2870440231028666

Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies.	0.9670532241286439
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country, then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card, as it were, for the reasons cited in this directive, which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution.	0.9212639815554693

But, probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members, the Council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at European level: a framework decision.	1.0489158959156364
Let us contemplate this result, derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy.	0.444960114707433
It is true, once again, and I accept this objectively, that there are still real legal problems.	1.1564965786923158

The process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as 1978 but clearly the fact that the British Government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far.	0.8254435489920294
Moreover, I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER+.	0.9655505634777612

You only have to realise that the category of "least developed countries" has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world' s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990.	0.8417140657711446
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?	0.9479535643245228

Why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us, but rather expect the usual people, the ones who live there all year, to pay for it and maintain it?	1.0512485163438705
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau, who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification, indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken, and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion.	0.8766728239684313
Ideally, I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges.	0.973350675512664
Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender. The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract.	0.6850894129365565
At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself.	1.083986597113494

The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion. In the autumn of last year, the latter stated: "Security within Europe is not divisible.	0.9902999353398257
This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition.	0.9994065032348355
Mr President, I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry, Mr Costa, and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed.	0.9253164721906386
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate, which all in all I have found to be encouraging and supportive, and it has also shown that there is a great deal of support in this House for the policy of the Member States and that of the Commission.	1.210061588390502
Mr President, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, in my opinion, and as Mr Prodi said this morning, the drawing up of the Charter is an exercise with great political significance. This is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project.	1.2229574697504682
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen.	1.1432160132694402
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.	0.9181199701021343

What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure.	0.9639150175167587
It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time.	0.9854712478852746
Is that really authorised?	0.267233388228545
Mr Tannock, with regard to the position adopted by the European Union, we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives, and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were propping up Mr Milosevic' s political system and acting as propaganda for him.	0.8503444818462467
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.	0.8515927720586128
But we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other Members about other countries, notably Indonesia, East Timor, the Moluccas and Burma.	0.8990057112478578
Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used.	1.0078702723151922
We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised.	0.908647343017254
The evidence is that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the European Union, going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998, which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire, especially in key areas of the internal market.	0.8347647654113207
However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them.	1.1755546165165995
Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other.	0.859312601026044
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this.	0.8918373519484857
We feel that these issues result from the IGC' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there.	0.8101419979043131
For the information of our colleagues, I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts: one third to prepare the mission, one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation, following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment.	0.8924764933736761
Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with.	0.5030378690233036
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year.	0.572655445985269
My second point concerns the universal provision of services. What is happening on this score, how much does it cost, how does it work, how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have?	1.0004044552459503
This is because it is essential to achieve two things: the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured, and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, mainly to the benefit of developing countries.	1.1669332021288372
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?	0.7276489787729524
All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years, not 16.	0.7235237537883226
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.	0.9202173788113304
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity.	0.7706118546484336
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices.	0.7338267961503493
I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.	1.2034047873769054

You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.	0.8512996071370083
These dossiers will be progressed by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals, which there is every indication the Commission is due to present in this area, which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection.	1.11143573108542
We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2014363760537363
I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.	1.0690112793508328
Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.	1.1168448300211
The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding, i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe, which is why we voted against this text.	1.0612370629671601

My vote was "in favour" .	0.565602797245427
In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.	1.0735284943310712
I say it again, the European Union' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament, the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort, at long last, to put some coherence into our policy.	1.2500678303161292
1999 was also marked by the German Presidency' s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.7299694603760011
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.	0.9681761787247817
Nevertheless, we believe, and I think this is also how the Commission sees things, that the whole process of approximation with the acquis communautaire with a view to overall integration of the island in the European Union through accession at some point in the future implies involving the communities in the north of the island as soon as possible. It may also give the European Union access to data enabling it to justify accession, as part of its efforts to assess accession conditions.	1.1404402972733645
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.	0.9494800347683027

First of all, Mr Andrews, you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development. There is no contradiction between our two positions, quite the opposite.	1.0533063170114865
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport.	0.7188298611195967

They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic, as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which, inexplicably, are not currently included in strand A, Annex 1.	0.9848153795487234
We have encountered several problems in some of the other languages, but have not been able to check all of these, and I would thus urge you to be mindful of problems of this type.	1.0432332791475212
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.	1.2089568912346806
By means of amendments adopted in committee, Parliament has tried to supplement the Commission' s work, by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid, and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in Southern Europe.	0.9930837094467355
As you can see, as a new MEP, I am trying to get to grips with the dossier and I must admit that I have great difficulty doing so.	1.1073824842197468
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an outright success due, in particular, to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators.	0.9452567209301186
The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory, most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions.	1.0136960244117208
Did these firms need state aid to survive?	0.6654708124993025

Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda' s work as rapporteur.	0.7710443463685043
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future.	0.7768195539177429

We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is "Less is sometimes more!"	0.8234279057097751
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally.	1.2428853516362104
We need to make our citizens feel at home, according to Mr Swoboda, and I agree.	1.1006757510881688
We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe.	0.831580740971264
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair, when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings, but these were neither heeded nor passed on.	0.8049454011120836
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.	0.6987393015882972

Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare?	0.5266709916920497
As long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few, it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils.	0.7242845907743297
First there is wide information for and involvement by the public, a rarity in a European directive.	0.8805972212843229
Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union.	0.9649024367329696
Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held.	1.1654014742327945
Even the British Minister, Peter Hain, conceded this recently. We should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government, he told President Dos Santos last month.	0.7071456821203526
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained.	1.181298625857567
I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do.	0.9433787630456543
With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas, I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country.	0.8238116226638448
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection.	1.0095207215935864
Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition.	1.0833759095595192

Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise.	0.8986047326382947
The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people' s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission' s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection.	1.0357087510078202
We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention.	0.8960979826805047
Consequently, the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and, since 1997, has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned.	1.248608368759901
The many contradictions and conflicting views over what Europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations.	0.5103616130282536
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all.	0.9448184393147422
The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally.	0.7662338245894431
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU.	0.7649951511493412
So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission' s duty.	1.2144181567121892
I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments.	1.006956399171744

That is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people.	1.0953944709048606
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe: our economy does not support the individual sufficiently, nor is it sufficiently dynamic.	0.9121109165562268
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment.	1.0381037377662632
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague, Mr Nielson, was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is, trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives.	0.9429761288187062
If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty.	1.1210877266164427
Indeed, we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations.	0.8372019250757243

A second remark made by Mr Gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates.	0.902105654501212
We would then be overreaching ourselves.	0.5737264233516107

No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years.	0.6138841112891587
Regarding immigration and asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.	0.8379712668204181
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000.	0.697654255152157
In this regard, too, I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate.	0.8018668168925753
This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators.	0.9639783444534312
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.	0.9339835106791372
The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities.	0.6593527041092493
I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.	0.8444391494428444
The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time: in agriculture, commerce, in conflict prevention, in the peace operations, in the fisheries sector, migration and environment.	0.9212371933872695
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which, in seeking to introduce greater flexibility, run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative.	0.9882352495690117
This preparatory work, this fine-tuning, must not be omitted, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful, and that it will not just be limited to technical details.	1.2845160840081165
It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States' national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions.	0.9772800009668026
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects.	1.165086756847117
As we have heard, the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas, bearing in mind that 80% of the population of Europe lives in cities.	0.8771910644453873
However, if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources.	1.346368777768988
Thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights, principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation: I am thinking of fair trials, and more particularly of the rights of the defence, of the impartiality and integrity of judges, of the length of legal proceedings, for which my country, Italy, unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down, of the cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights.	0.9130920093201476
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.	0.6524306185188753
Thank you for your answer.	0.6170619324401986
Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it.	1.0378109379280367
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.	0.5812239623854225

In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.	0.8623241004864929
There is, of course, the question of pre-accession aid, and this belongs in category seven.	0.9833208886290361
We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty.	0.8698966249046994
But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries.	0.8894463701688632
Mr President, we debated the framework directive on water this week, and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water.	1.0959043925119243
I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density.	1.085211903562095
In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date.	0.7843296045381735
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the final decision of the Council, we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties, so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see.	0.9775111220233251
It also means that, when we are fighting these diseases, the problem of destroying whole herds in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or BSE and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda.	0.8610743138488972
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union' s role in international development policies is significant.	0.8608573673165304
We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river.	0.8229945344430657
But now I call on you, in all consciousness, to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital.	1.013758016329092
This relates in particular to the intended agenda, particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers, which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future. This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union.	0.9790670690380365
If we assume that, on average, a car has a life of eleven years, do Members, indeed does anyone, believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem?	0.9394391316494917
You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process.	1.0861674970642774
. I welcome Mr Brok' s report supporting with amendments the Commission' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership.	0.8979706152173135
Well, today, the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam, who has, in the meantime, become a European Commissioner, Mr Barnier, proposes to decide, at the forthcoming IGC, that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision.	1.1872735371377348
Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.	1.0968947770165551
We all have a duty to put our own house in order.	0.630664582662388
Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation.	0.9756725929170434
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union' s aims.	0.9538294323704672
It is Commissioner Bolkestein' s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year.	1.0582966763237496
We promote participatory approaches, we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU.	0.8968559744605261
Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability.	0.8469318917402668
You might have added, Mr Solana, 'to give me their instructions' , because that is what we see, in fact.	1.1292261363830793
Brussels is not all of us, as you claim. It is all of you.	1.1375994135219893
Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism.	1.030303753207093
In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.	0.9790155261662138
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient?	0.7859709590534548
The World Bank has decided not to fund the project, which will displace 20 000 Kurds, potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage.	0.7197135614536332
Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden.	1.0911905071269257
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them, while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups.	0.6671438438886343
I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.	0.7269656367428438
It is about brominated flame retardants.	0.730786650829276
In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors.	1.0709910899895665
(Loud applause)	0.1484583906385195
Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important.	0.8147098628492562
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity.	0.7978819899385282
What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union.	1.199298067331923
It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States.	1.0619412949257272
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar' s eyes, and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE.	0.9181534789729249
Parliament is committed to this task, which is something this report bears impressive witness to.	0.9754348860369879
Mr President, first I want to compliment the rapporteur, Charlotte Cederschiöld, on drawing up this report, which is an excellent point of departure for increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro.	0.9544948499370353
If car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies, this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances.	0.6618236384731849
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks, whether intentional or unintentional.	1.0783023271635694
The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.	1.0843325810390407
The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction.	0.7347350470887356
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.	0.7273974192672251
As far as I know, that has still not happened.	0.9398784916242672
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true, and that figures do not lie.	0.8913628934433506
I too should like to ask the European Union to put its own house in order here, i.e. to call on Member States which still have gold mines to commission expert reports, so that we know just what the situation is.	1.0572159767505152
Action simply has not been taken.	0.5730879932057675
However, the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.	1.089450357476652
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.	0.41205562887078956
I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing, at a later date.	0.9394010433309902
Company restructuring in Europe	0.1551606182183743
The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time.	0.8511663387226598
All in all, I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report.	1.145241793766854
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.	0.6611861619614168
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is.	0.8912370707558782
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments, including a re-instatement of the Commission' s original budget.	0.8157633133756571
Storms in Europe	-0.0
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety?	0.6596189884226582
On the one hand, we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote, precisely so that this convention - which, I repeat, already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning, while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law.	0.922226795847943
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.	0.54619720782186
Mr President, the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all.	1.0514250051280178
The problem, however, should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget. This sermon, therefore, really belongs in the Council.	1.064014199999471
It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed.	0.8881079637427465
. As regards the Commission's position with respect to the amendments tabled by Parliament I wish to confirm what my colleague stated during the debate in this House on Tuesday, 15 February.	1.1048573870513767
My conclusion regarding INTERREG, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this. They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union.	1.0596680646057484
Two million people died of AIDS in Africa last year, approximately 200 000 died in wars.	0.6686084730415092
In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations.	0.6940974861127814
We all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment. It is also due to the recognition by the European Union, since the 1997 conference on these issues, of the enormous potential, represented by tourism, for employment.	0.99315154593138
Thirdly, we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question.	1.0698766934908126
To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation.	1.1131288533963488
The Commission appreciates Parliament' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role.	0.8423266157728809

We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation.	0.9274824649318366
Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion, this was a real relief.	1.066337476622964
Mr President, committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary, but not amendments from individual Members.	0.7311969874308303
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered.	1.1093090522439883
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.	0.6873140713546
Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation.	0.6048372577878506
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.	0.9365186951712994
On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.	1.1982148964969244
In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place.	0.9161441155128905
The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today, before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow.	0.8630480395716393
That is not correct.	0.8613127819736893
It is an obvious truth, and one that is measurable by other economic and social indicators, that thanks to tourism, many Mediterranean regions have undergone a radical change for the better in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitants, and achieved a drastic reduction in the numbers emigrating.	1.1083262105959166
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads, and to repair them as quickly as possible.	1.0099290386770785
In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level.	1.0608047167866932
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.	0.7231236949644972
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.	0.8697981658313295

Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite).	0.7157811712257118
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.	1.0905283617738637
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.	1.1015587692757007
In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over.	0.8695858658863752
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.	0.44838689194062176
This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit.	0.9088234788973588
There is one other specific point which is dear to me: Member States should be able, if they so wish, to set up trans-national water transfers.	1.0541790904272486
There is huge duplication of effort.	0.2640324344519438
What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty?	0.6339173530846874
Mr President, the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance.	1.0097962281812891
We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.	0.8435360492335269
As Mr Sterckx said, we certainly need to do this vis-à-vis the United States which, after all, is close to us in terms of democratic values.	0.9203770526309265
Parliament supports this.	0.23819487874759473
If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.	0.8927288378593081
Furthermore, like the rapporteur, I think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields.	0.9901091756559561
Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions.	1.0673219469746225
I am also saying this as a former environment minister.	0.9860900350064319
I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners.	1.018188420877139
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth.	1.2026538936774418
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming, mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs.	0.9322986418092594
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.	0.9590474005124648
We all know that!	0.47588037063959204
Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out.	1.18678356316006
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the European Union' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully-fledged Community policy on tourism, increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs.	0.7987400549827258
We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe.	0.8895570889608285
We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic.	0.8692400658575309
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible, we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments, and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects, including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for.	1.0065032447128766
We have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme. This is not entirely President Prodi' s fault.	1.0657535522592212
The main problem is a financial one, namely who bears the cost?	0.9479015579213612
I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework.	1.036478062065344
We will conduct this dialogue with our citizens, including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres.	0.8329300248153259
Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money.	1.044063950645544
And a woman was elected.	0.33048891620527854
For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them.	1.0422183006842882
The Commission' s proposal takes it as read that OTC derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that UCITS deal in, but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risks.	1.0051147624233499
On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts.	0.9483990436134234
Given that the complexity of the procedures has been greatly reduced, I voted in favour not only because this measure addresses the need for cohesion between these applicant States and the Union, but also because I believe that this should be taken as an invitation from Parliament to the Council and the Commission to ensure that Cyprus and Malta become fully-fledged members of the European Union as swiftly as possible.	1.1976594648402588
A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.	0.5757679357785415
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens.	0.8505261317489358
We need, in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe, to go back to the natural order of the universe, i.e. to the Creation, and beyond that still further, to the Creator' s intention.	0.9521054048382275
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings.	0.808985611214375
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas.	0.728497016471324
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.	0.6025412262246862
That concludes the explanations of vote.	0.6395414044340633
I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance.	0.8279170552008471
We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense.	1.2172664664328663
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and, if necessary, give additional support under URBAN.	1.1887723134902881
This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made: fear of modernisation, globalisation, and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security.	0.7621489219948062
Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.	1.088952094381106
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala.	1.0296131339088028
Firstly, I would remind you that the tourist industry is one of the infrastructures which any advanced society must have. Without it, institutions, business and the world of work could not function.	0.9432782040316493

The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy.	0.7944394838221546

The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.	1.0201430393453674
Human rights, which the EU embraces, are thus under threat, but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated.	1.1999129040160064

I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries.	0.9521270237991438
Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull' in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks.	0.9976848442225236
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.	0.7547798550723411

In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance.	0.9897744046849476

One reason for the acceptance of this proposal, and of the campaigns by NGOs such as ATTAC, SOLIDAR or others which have popularised this proposal, is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries, in areas such as education or health.	1.0675755953996426

Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.	1.0898169716539987

Mr President, sadly, once again, Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe.	0.8943981676228911
However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform.	0.9263007096867293
With regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud, and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interests, we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor. We have done this in the spirit of this House' s work and perhaps by going down the same road.	1.2095181371376658
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past.	1.2749535174560203
Secondly, we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable.	1.1614241921107986

As the French say, "ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du bain" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees.	1.077247367495215
When it comes to tourism, we can no longer do what we like where we like.	0.9249522811015163
We are making an overall value judgement about NATO' s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO' s action.	1.098127292802376
I say this just so that we know where we stand.	0.9496681087155238

This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions.	0.958248093656846
My question to the President-in-Office is twofold.	0.6732389821237662
Lastly then, Europol, which started its work in 1999. The Council approved a set of instruments, with which Parliament is familiar, to make Europol' s operations viable but, of course, the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain, and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in Tampere to reinforce Europol' s powers and, above all, to give it an operational dimension.	1.1256223813519
I hope and wish, and am indeed certain, that the European Union, with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt, will little by little construct, in the wider area, the necessary environment which it needs itself.	1.091470065805465
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this.	0.7125807815955371

Mr President, as others have done, I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced.	1.0746903829823529
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system.	1.2235445727463072
As a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world, of which the EU is just one proof, and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western values, competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades.	1.231752802445782
On this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments.	0.6078804271640524
However, I would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested.	1.0690223116607986
I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order.	0.7940068778324741
I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive.	1.1994696210000353
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then 'prohibition' .	0.5874987828698067
It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects.	0.7710098440337859
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that.	0.7150016814227215
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed.	0.7784538619267878
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died.	0.39181767016630253
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity.	0.47998707185162925
First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.	0.9744664646484715
That is the one word I am talking about.	0.9092430006765215
We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament.	1.0235250464833492
Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.	0.8278707532516533
The present directive has three aims. First of all, we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars.	0.8821773614435365
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy, which we shall have the opportunity to address together, aims to ensure more effective protection of competition, reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people.	1.0976400249114873
Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible.	0.9883798350675367
In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either.	0.9017921588198236
But this also serves to make a claim, on the part of the European Union, for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public.	1.1552442752974845
The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs.	0.8093339990942852
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments.	0.4772463502102305
They will take a long time, as we are finding out.	1.2091403127609226
Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States.	0.7204371889627936
. (EL) On reading the Commission' s statement on social protection, which is animated by so many good intentions, one wonders whether its authors and the working people in Europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality.	0.9694476114597658
Let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations, not a vast sum in the Community budget, and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus.	0.9977592908202433
. Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday.	0.9065697173736363
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed.	1.044493747467828
I therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief.	0.7215952759638092
The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds.	0.6895923588891685
And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long.	1.0984264523831804
This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context.	0.9630105075818032
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year?	0.4781159678827846
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard.	0.8552733303995455
But it is time for the legislation to be updated.	0.9432330630596615
The views of the European Parliament on this issue too, will certainly be both timely and welcome.	1.2076348992798496
We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated.	0.605976719993425
Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.	1.0077205420353677
Mr President, I would like to begin with some words of optimism, which came to us in the form of the High-Level Group communication of October 1998, the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade, it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the Union.	0.9328663179995815
No notice was given of the closure, and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers, despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private.	0.8876098100362407
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas, ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models.	0.8515147653710549

This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes.	0.9637824164193456
However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.	1.1274460531313593
Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force.	0.8307030474751913
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.	0.666763740010828
Mr President-in-Office, do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an abomination for the continent of Europe, a shameful thing, which should motivate us all, so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous?	0.8185674502873227
If you had been there, I am sure you would have been ashamed.	1.1046634337749888

(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.	1.0983029368448727
This is a big problem in my opinion.	1.2154385078114496
The report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism.	1.0218401136494237
This is an area of unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes, it will not happen.	1.2210351449737378

In France, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate, when this was being ratified, many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making.	1.1376734292991537

Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):	0.406638319640468
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.	1.2164153231200956

Much like in the Netherlands, where, at a given point, women woke up to the fact that, by referring to European legislation, they could improve their status in terms of social security, this is now also the case for scores of other citizens.	1.0700963860706603
I share some of the concerns expressed here, especially by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, but this face-lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index, and which are therefore managed either passively or not at all, and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively-managed fund were treated in the same way, if only to allow medium-sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market.	1.0027698120924695

But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council.	1.1008887087021775
That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits.	0.520179473276509

I feel therefore that extending and enriching European citizens' participation in culture is a crucial task, one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it, and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union.	1.0178499819986115
If this cannot be adopted as the objective, then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020.	1.1223047117946918

Now to the implementation of INTERREG, a subject mentioned by many of you, and the potential eligibility under strand A, 'cross-border cooperation' , of schemes in the Adriatic, on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote regions, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points.	0.9858171380762415

We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular.	1.0334433402640713
If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation.	0.7623277059752849
In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning Haider' s party, as well as all the parties throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted in favour of the compromise resolution. We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms, in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery.	1.0457355099573045

We must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - Parliament is sometimes a little extremist, adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and, all things considered, find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members, who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible.	0.8545701227554515

Similarly, the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding.	0.823388725579272
We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned.

It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace, democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe, no less?	1.008740814998943
To that end, the Commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services, the consequences of liberalising cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector, the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process, excluding distribution, and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies.	1.0344513883449666

I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty, but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament.	1.159156660814593
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees.	0.7832969216993004

It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied.	1.0661867354641934

As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State.	0.9493609770344538
In my Group, there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro' s report.	0.8467322795128794
Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.	0.8206945802424995
All of this will provide greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes, into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme, which we will be discussing soon.	1.1304629137178683
Mr President, I am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our African origin.	0.8509533071519766
Madam President, I am totally appalled by the Commission' s, i.e. Mr Bolkestein' s, political ignorance!	0.9758767575545966
Mr President, the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser' s or a fitness centre.	0.8599594132306365
Are there any comments?	0.2741369579693864
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.	0.7002086042400889
Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.	0.9299030369915624
But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters, and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity, rather than nicely formulated institutions.	0.9126020551643073
I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation.	0.7506294440177357
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise.	0.8653930714284513
They fly in the face of the very principles on which - as Mr Havel said yesterday - the European Union was founded: principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights.	0.9949977285957562
This I think is the new Convention.	1.0861044713804526
If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion, if a request is made at all, then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult, unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all.	1.0696397714652779
Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests.	0.6338024636682096
This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region.	1.0623317731018929
As far as the second proposal is concerned, I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments.	1.1228954695597508
So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis?	0.9632724284497316
But hedging operations are already allowed in the existing Article 21(1) of Directive 611/85 on UCITS.	0.6022206963895844

They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case.	1.1419937292087357
Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible.	1.1659727726823619
Mr Marset Campos, you will be aware, first of all, of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation, particularly an air-based one, and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that, whilst they are not military targets as such, are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine.	1.024004877257286
Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed.	0.7260661078051843
Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.	0.748316584139534
He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion.	0.6598924019703863
Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly.	0.8202890722174385
I just want to conclude by saying that a number of Members of Parliament think that the present proposal goes too far, while others think that I am not sufficiently liberal.	1.145471470297301
Can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that women are treated equally and fairly, that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion, belief, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, opinion, political affiliation etc?	0.6013074256469878
Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail.	0.7104794168862304
And yet President Prodi himself gave firm guidance to the Italian Government during those years and is therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifices demanded of our fellow citizens and which they made in order to sign up to the euro, and he is aware of the major role played by Italy in European development.	0.8026282267938604
That, combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country, in the area of minorities and democratic institutions, would round off the image of political maturity which FYROM has, in fact, presented in other respects and which has made our European family welcome closer relations with it.	0.8818897918097017
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents.	0.965050540267517
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.	1.027779011872236
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary.	0.767541813381143
Today' s debate makes it quite clear that Parliament wants more emphasis on speed, not speed at the expense of quality, but then slowness alone does not mean quality either.	0.9141793846242393
So be it. But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies.	0.7485750608338744
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.	0.640398360922317
Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy.	0.7254092328140331
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired.	0.6998607073207873
We need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility.	0.5225065358350478
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.	0.9935113859407728
For this reason, I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises.	0.9136357538664719
Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that, if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out, it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted, in other words, reclaim the money from the Member States?	0.8355106407352839
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by tender, with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested. We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised.	0.9559665856826124
This is no longer tolerable.	0.633919368599172
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder.	0.7323524836998743
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado.	0.9203195349746499
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can.	1.096932249132617
Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation.	0.7419477195549036
We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity.	0.8619592941540913

As far as Cyprus is concerned, part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the Greek and Turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all.	0.8657286331100307
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency.	0.8084317244075858
I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board.	1.021851175116273
This is no longer tolerable.	0.6650978271820928

(FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta, whose accession is vital to the future of the European Union in the Mediterranean.	0.85937866247934
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification.	1.0118201990694404
Mr Haarder, to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing.	0.8098438764186019

I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission' s proposal.	0.903788684292571

Cosmetic, medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous.	0.7072950381764862
This worries me because this means that, when adopting texts, we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation. This will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal.	1.0017531328142673
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.	0.9781106519055195
Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time, Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level.	0.5183890570733242
What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe, and their families, and the fishing industries, both the extractive and processing and marketing industries, and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports, in so many European regions, in most cases peripheral regions, who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority?	1.0864972583691583
If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes.	0.9819710510917735
You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that, given the tense situation, Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all.	0.88344568110122
These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will draw to a close within the year, results in constitutional reform, providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government.	0.8652467905393606
I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects.	1.015561876124541
We must establish dialogue with other forces in Angola, be attentive to the appeals of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions, national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war. These can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades.	0.865185185882649
Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties.	0.8224807055859583
On the contrary, we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill, and those who support and express understanding for the latter, from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom.	0.9551100480624521
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.	1.0039931381433902
The policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism.	0.5271190063074763
Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.	0.9759315776150644
A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State.	1.1307040734144675
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework.	0.7930997894552666
While we are on the subject, where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend European interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way, one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict, which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the Commission to fight its corner.	0.8211324067102576

Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party.	0.983852670410974
Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union?	1.0299622748650328

Incidentally, it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals.	0.7187219834008327

It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident.	0.8126781991018945
I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event.	1.2346210099428103

The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system.	0.6702816355244148
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.	1.1454626935313397
There are therefore two possible solutions: either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark, or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements.	0.8444079606911528
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today' s debate.	0.988563456468476
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.	0.7195815422630687
And the merit of Mr Corrie' s report is that it highlights the value of this original, proactive development instrument, together with the work carried out by the Joint Assembly.	0.7823158408765895
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments.	0.8748476111360598
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women.	0.9267343628554026

How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute?	0.8473531075078644
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers.	1.0208737168292743

We will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned.	0.694474380277436
In this context, Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society, which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999.	1.0528728113640378
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.5521054817025929
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis.	0.9963886269119432
Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon.	0.7985892444209615
Furthermore, behind these programmes, that is to say, the SAVE programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings, and the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy, there lies an extremely important technological challenge, which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole.	1.1465937988623918

And no one can comprehend this attitude.	0.5509428358595162
With the approval of this agreement, we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned. However, it constitutes real progress in the right direction, which is something we do not wish to obstruct.	1.0743487282611544
If we have success in this threefold sense, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens, will believe more in Europe, and this seems to me to be very important because, ultimately, the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life.	1.1433596924371061
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.0647272074987126
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive.	0.9775996919816882
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if our neighbour' s roof is leaking, we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water, but it is, of course, more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof.	0.741057439065267

I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.	0.8533557039029016
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes?	1.0451373265241175
Let us look at some of these reasons.	0.8520640211877818
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date.	0.6263816883089994

We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect.	0.9303467471981803
Secondly, under the reconstruction programme, urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme.	0.7552938825826081
My question to the Commissioner is this: what is to be done?	1.228302592156257
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.	0.7974932652764759
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga, will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter.	0.7040628062924427
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on.	1.07029450161865
We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited.	0.5222542608002816

Madam President, I am amazed at Mr Corbett' s reaction.	0.9173459247904129
As a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled, either in Austria or in any other Member State.	0.9163504856901079
The directive applies to complete cars, that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing.	0.7717071271886885
Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement.	1.1583168745545385
As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies.	0.9980446890537797
I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment, talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia, racism, etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted.	0.8530940967249077
The damage to your country, Mr President, and to mine, Spain, could be horrendous.	1.1729397619980568

There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area.	0.678142107423035

Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!	1.0760613588833015
In the area of environment, we are looking at ways to cooperate with Mrs Wallström; in the area of regional policy Mr Barnier is giving a lot of attention to this sector.	1.075071254531938
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.	1.0522131007052131

We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right.	0.8514906716737316
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission.	0.6222926580996594
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe.	0.4232020781556493
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect.	1.0426138618235532
This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly, I have always voted against the death penalty.	0.9963956005163586
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone.	0.5425253699458732
For the first time, the European Union tabled a resolution on the death penalty, which was enormously successful, and led work on a resolution concerning children' s rights, which was a joint initiative with the Latin American group of countries.	1.124671223694195
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.	0.9168918353871707
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	0.61270198515586
We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched.	0.9378822769435405
However, turning to the substance, I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the following: that for all national and regional programmes, Greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the European Union - via its central administration, its central government.	0.9131449736857098
What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable.	0.6766417752271647
Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status.	0.8031056066650061
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.	0.9274181988508414
This means that this proposal' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers, but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services.	1.0618286790483393
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration.	0.6772786745376105
In spite of all its virtues though, LIFE III' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument' s impact, which is its budget.	0.8571049315382205
What can the European Union do in these circumstances?	1.0654985992685089
We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day.	1.156430106288116
You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners.	0.8793398456798792
Are there any comments?	0.2795344586739831
Of course, that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation, in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures, which are the cause of great aridity.	0.9619239223020862
There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union' s foreign policy.	0.7511754498269257
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority.	0.2351931256677252
But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span.	0.9006455338402108
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission.	0.7289355226102912

We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme.	0.7885450362605727
The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force.	0.6221104762903249
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption?	0.6451888813316564
The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.	0.7658164661277931
However, the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people' s self-determination.	0.9879737793073077
The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities, better known as ISD, is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion.	0.9001932809983633
These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority.	0.8786678824847235
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes (CIP).	0.7756677468791063
It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece.	1.0218265342322341
The important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthening relations between the European Union and the ACP countries needs to be stressed.	0.9073852421181476
Why, in these circumstances, is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised?	1.0477674941279842
This does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda.	0.6563327934748151
This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation, in other words, increased wealth, but when we look at how this wealth is distributed, we see, unfortunately, that the gulf between the world' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase.	0.7927855535884815
I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them.	0.7813176211460098
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy.	0.9523080558503045
We are discussing coherence here.	0.8134121254994112
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas.	0.6606390542802261
The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed.	1.03839946823165
Let me explain.	0.2888851699905421
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance.	0.4329690331205057

To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles.	0.8237153555017789
I think there are three reasons for this: 1) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states, the European institutions have lost touch with the people and, in losing touch with the people, they have become putty in the hands of foreign interests; 2) having lost touch with the people, the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole champions of the people, but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system; 3) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains; but it also causes far more to be lost because, when it breaks nations, it breaks subtle expressions of solidarity and, with them, the willingness to present a united front.	1.0208898256163552
In this respect, Mr Bolkestein, the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tobin tax.	0.9713418809201934
When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers.	0.8784290493250851
Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk.	0.6379923099634587
The main changes are as follows: all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes, such as the use of information technology, improving the quality of life, and adding value to local products.	0.9101238155675722
Lastly, I must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area, as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non-governmental organisations who act on the ground.	0.9311593811007727
Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo.	1.0947829246960046
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness, fairness, consistency and professionalism.	0.5954625256767693
But would you, Commissioner, also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you, with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress?	0.9273509750848218
The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals.	0.6787508912057258
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party.	0.7074245541143203

Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone' s reach in society.	0.5708736905834845
We must monitor compliance with environmental standards, employment standards, in order to prevent dumping in this area, and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid, which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up, we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid, internal distortions by other countries, from being transferred to the international arena, in other words, through trickery.	1.0834431942758647
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process.	1.0135079520770756
We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.	1.2493063418273935
I was able to talk to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit about this issue when I visited Ankara myself, and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with Turkey' s particular approach to this question, I believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss.	0.9156336088399603
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions, including the energy sector.	0.8111464360791536
The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life, even when we disagree, the better this will be, provided that we talk about this objectively.	0.9365732360901786
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism.	0.8488467967715753
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration.	0.7282639301756976
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.	0.8157697484561487
The Commission is not in fact today a European government.	1.0769252844405794
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected?	0.6902482841354589
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.	0.8946815714466653
I ask for the Member's understanding for this small delay in the Commission's decision.	1.0187209808788305
We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward.	1.0048058684839278
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues.	0.6440121442277792
Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	1.2385292708359383
However, the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems.	1.0125150291547855
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure.	0.41065275765549814
However, after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle.	1.026130900740296
We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December.	1.0205610761022732
I consider this to be unacceptable.	0.5014770251464036
I am opposed to making the car owners liable.	0.4541284882785799
However, I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive.	0.9400768277953825
One of the objections is that, due to the restricted role of the elected bodies, businesses gain more influence.	0.7283139992956289
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public.	1.0343646640356814
I am aware that there may be different views about NATO' s action and the legitimacy of that action.	0.8806665428372391
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable.	0.9648546649407032
Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction.	0.7655437454134265
Do we have a special problem in this regard?	1.373374770420692
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.	0.9100361103992235
Finally, I would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions, speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation.	0.7409183334980606
We need to have a long memory when we say: " for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."	1.151874412395718
There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over, not just because it was over, but because we all knew that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries.	1.037336401800538
What is the Commission' s verdict on this?	0.8372899760194246
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet.	0.8912781638275502
Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda.	0.7212753114062181
You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure.	0.6082876470655512
The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting.	0.6149458559963714
We have had the dioxin scare, BSE and many other problems.	0.8822907280300754
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	0.9831475447653608
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc.	0.5285908701902373
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.	0.7182593117760661
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.	0.835653617662668
But what will those limits be?	0.5696141003122527
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down.	0.47075821860312705
This financial instrument is, furthermore, deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations.	0.5665310351389731
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	0.8062756883644286
Consequently, we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars.	0.8298839056392675
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War.	0.9708719097303314
B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,	0.6590493076494908
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year.	0.878130988096437
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea.	0.8395435700416014
Subject: Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	0.9324968315733697
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.	0.4691070673968573
Clearly, what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control, towards systems based on private insurance agencies, which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people, who besides the higher cost, will 'enjoy' even more degraded social provisions.	0.9193802286911474
I also hope that, if there is any life in outer space, as has been speculated by Mr Newton Dunn, it was tuned in to Mr Havel' s speech as well.	1.001459278584127
Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure.	1.155163083698637
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.1271594325759271
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice.	0.6077065546534024
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund. We therefore demand, if this motion is adopted tomorrow, that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion.	1.0740666793769584
Today, it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it.	0.7628207538818448
They will look into the matter thoroughly.	0.7180105494400443
Obviously, the fact that Parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the March figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria.	0.8499858122197985
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, somehow or other, today' s agenda has come full circle.	0.7196250954598973
The next item is the report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS)).	0.5045642263143776
It only remains to put this principle into practice.	0.5328323492505374
The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote.	0.8684132686256124
It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used.	0.9630849106257267
The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas, and to show where, when and why, problems occur with coherence of policy, rather than sweeping it all under the carpet.	0.9438900939148533
It was this practice which led to the Commission' s downfall.	0.8776363223897744
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.	0.4660749334596508
However, I would like to concentrate on two points.	0.8679440986660709
Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year.	1.0089537877713322
As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved, however, we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance.	0.9361313083636619
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice.	0.6413423754899632
They see unequal treatment of men and women, of people of different ages, of minorities, of people of different coloured skins, of races, of beliefs, of immigrants, even neighbours.	1.1082740568818281
As I said, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.8968350829284326
In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on.	0.8743000255536226
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.	1.0764727368361817
These include, for example, costs and transfers.	0.5313633175149642
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning.	0.9266640308101148
We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products.	0.5588429801557129
Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious.	0.9599356564814187
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text, simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp.	0.7424471746528055
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice.	0.8428615678450279
In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d)), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources.	0.9637406092288371
We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously.	0.8206772970732849
However, there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved.	0.9792252389945026
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.	1.0095144069238426
Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it.	0.8636397031660923
On the contrary, I object to this systematically applied strategy.	0.6503501490831626
As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective.	1.0342571604558575
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.6360346132279768
. Mr President, I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely combating TSEs.	1.014384161940812
They see a beautiful planet, teeming with life, but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up.	0.6679441188160424
In brief, this Parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters.	0.7559399168175212
We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community. At the same time, we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists.	0.9252567677496984
In view of all this, I think it is a serious contradiction that there is no European policy on tourism.	1.2075516623993998
Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day.	0.8080837034307043
The Socialist Group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors.	0.5319739600489686
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed.	0.8019086670354486
It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas.	0.8576564688184122
Madame McNally, in general, I am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations.	0.9645389261013215
Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the Basque Country. We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop.	0.979905720102097
I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment.	0.9879144686509593
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry.	0.8685947032530474
This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.	0.8633247266355556
The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.	0.9557785192337285
It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days.	0.7686295101881326
Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements.	0.5898701488414462
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	0.9516655081893615
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February, but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content.	0.9475161915945856
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions, criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings, economic exploitation of immigrants, and sexual exploitation of woman and children, with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication, notably the Internet, for distributing child pornography.	0.8446865054488142
We have made a start, and we hope the work will produce some excellent results.	1.16017144902183
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)	0.774023138747427
This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248.	0.6601692316461979
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.	0.6446634655082473
Proposals are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission, which checks their conformity with the general guidelines, adopted.	1.076060501386933
I think the statement' s content makes this clear.	0.8140424636265289
After five years only four have done so.	0.4147686198760179
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382.	0.5162459769244901
I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament.	1.0210281795595515
The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on.	0.701994970815771
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.	1.1914824675709696
Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies?	0.9272164322301871
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.	0.5184777209371509
(Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez) We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya.	1.158607311389042
Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators.	0.6032517051849604
The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but especially in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, worthwhile and permanent jobs, the competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr Evans, that of Wales, but not only of Wales.	1.2117182980214287
One of the most important things, for me, personally, is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under.	1.0724723265267222
If it chooses the second approach, it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is built.	0.9577066477951053
I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups.	0.908718406586698
The German version is not very clear here.	0.7024954477070456
As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency.	0.9388024320886017
Many of them are based upon the very constructive, informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading.	1.0177887408147526
A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements.	0.6859144981594252
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who work on rural areas know that, of the programmes which the European Union has managed, the LEADER programme, both LEADER I and LEADER II, is one of its success stories, and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER+.	1.154568319450684
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union.	0.8385398575392152
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.	0.568496053070092
I accept that Mr Andersson's report is very well-intentioned, and I respect him for the work he has done, but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the EU.	1.026792643572138
In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease.	0.4589700064417066
In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable.	1.1344641716552302
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level.	0.6972794496826479
This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty.	0.45919189222276807
In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.	0.802387094393749
There, the border question is obviously central.	0.6956781467820017
The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but, rather, better use of available resources.	0.7936451381557565
We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision.	0.645405416557444
But none of this hides the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence, because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the United States this weekend, we will have to remember that, for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region, 60 are contributed by the European Union.	0.8999684243549165
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society' s criminal law, policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU' s control.	0.600382325653372
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted.	0.7007645954143975
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners.	1.1718707399503514
The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems.	0.9733149797532614
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.	0.9838298069143498
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter.	1.0922849688218381
Madam President, the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia, concentration camps, anti-Semitism, heightened nationalism or war.	0.6804413446471395
I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds.	1.0370051924233508
We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians.	0.7096786362264207
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner.	0.7834299627840966
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.	0.9787312467848371
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court.	1.3052779144117925
There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment.	0.7989915159686614
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation.	0.77241874583094
The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself, without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient, and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC.	1.0998556019609544
Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive.	1.236640846502314
We too want to help put Europe on its feet.	0.8438067415768682
On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.	0.8420849111776872
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen.	0.9096613956855385
However, as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will, since the sanctions stipulated under Article 7 of the Treaties are virtually impossible to apply, will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure?	0.9816690265506086
Mr President, we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection.	0.9461468870873551
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States.	0.9493508342441364
This kind of situation should not be allowed.	0.8969247543934329
Mr President, we are unable to vote for this report.	1.0599448603469477
By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.	0.8458401923313308
One urban district post office after another is being closed down.	0.44693792070361266
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end.	0.567611456766155
We feel that the European Union and the Commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism, which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment, after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment.	0.9640179944365083
She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit.	0.6294997139749258
Apparently, they were.	1.0977404525630639
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time.	1.1632541725755734
Now that is where the difficulties begin, because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the Treaty of Maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro - so as not to frighten the voters by over-egging the pudding.	0.7883737319198625
One or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully.	0.8397646542581264
A mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty, but, until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups, we are just covering up the real problems.	0.7606513022749404
Firstly, I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate, for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system.	0.8951565404477775
In addition, I note that Parliament shares the Commission' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER+ is the use of global grants.	0.8159989815848075
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used, so creating uncertainty about the Commission' s attitude to the issue.	0.9149394494364392
And I shall end, of course, by congratulating Mr Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee.	1.2061131201054465
Even if we hear nothing else, we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see.	1.1473762347533754
In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run.	0.7685641519706798
That is my conclusion today.	0.630998741373808
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.	0.660162787456062
It has been shown, as we have been claiming since 1995, that this move is appalling, and, if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement, that is fine by us, but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay.	1.048127937639789
It is clear that the justice sector, more than any other, cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner.	0.8490912382997764
This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy. In this connection, I expect our three institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to be in agreement.	1.339625993753764
In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence.	1.0397770732363107
It is also true, however, that, since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, 39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and, more importantly, this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with, since, under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover.	1.0287707447596728
Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid.	1.2319857646295955
Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise, their dynamism and their flexibility.	0.5142430176367367
And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community.	0.9549470110732723
As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons.	0.8471408129373567
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment.	0.8041052204417934
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities.	0.5309993569281297
I hope that before the end of this new Lomé Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member.	1.0079403817523933
Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:	0.9808849266579892
There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again.	0.7150961242660068
Are we naively to grant 'freelance' enterprises the right to operate selectively and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot, of course, be checked?	0.7229374457843862
As the report itself indicates, the funds allocated to the URBAN II programme for the 2000-2006 period are approximately 30% less than those in the previous period, which were already low, at EUR 900 million. Added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is pathetic when practically all European city districts, both suburban and inner city, are affected.	1.0806799121271222
We have before us Malta and Cyprus, which are two States keen to become members.	0.7324785337207206
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity.	0.9884949080234189
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise, but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold.	0.9044967366017144
Personally, I am pleased with some of the replies, for example, in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention, which we hope will be reviewed, and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities.	0.9475524592371324
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with.	0.7709295471947735
All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves, in the medium term, to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus.	0.8664193938352707
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this?	0.9369404253934228
I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis.	0.7210059439266544
I cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected.	0.9475354965477459
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative.	0.6133430612707114
Management companies which are denied access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another Member State.	0.7661418425507502
Since Tampere, there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent.	0.7987308385950361
The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it.	1.3381325446778982
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards, which used to be a common feature in our Member States, would then disappear.	0.8961660667075502
The work should, of course, be regulated and subject to license in the future too, but the same rules cannot apply to, for example, Finland and Greece, which suffers from drought.	0.9656166060065153
In my opinion, Angola is a test case.	0.5541349852260299
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations.	0.6846782485254611
It would be Europe' s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe.	0.8320872028869352
The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights.	0.7884378934044243
However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	1.0116563988758915
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union.	0.6509731970737679
We must work to ensure that, in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally, the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords.	1.0292842337145078
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track.	0.8467506786747101
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction.	0.7971660582980253
I cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by NATO, but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree.	1.0499726247435697
Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that, in common with my Scottish colleague, he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again.	0.8811674393709616
In theory, we could have done so.	1.0489934831196042
I emphasise the word 'could' , and that is if it is done well and with care.	0.8458052540601199
I consider this to be very encouraging news.	0.7207348332233547
Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly, but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval.	0.6056695715529897
It may well be that others are worse, but that does not place us in any better a light.	0.9289967779878002
At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course.	0.7864632268147873
I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term, if not for the long term.	0.9431623534780803
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.	0.9643008457388013
The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union.	1.0172304746901297
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.	0.7107460511851269
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.	0.623649029253057
But we do reserve the right, when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation, to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out.	0.9281697057837796
The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole.	0.8571519874493594
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side.	0.6913497220341316
The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system.	0.9372671995096766
There are, however, two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text.	0.702632319027868
Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here.	0.9223683634276159
Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner?	0.5651383410914474
The report contains arguments that are too disparate, which do not link together smoothly, and everything thus hinges on approximations.	0.8102433949613181
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council is not present today.	1.0333915707458396
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.	0.7460818704367205
I will not go into the details due to lack of time, but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses.	1.0235727869588849
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular. That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going, that is, with regard to political relations that is.	0.9956670963683794
I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament.	0.7172318107262844
We are currently holding a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually gave us accurate information on the deficit.	0.8741194013003221
I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France's Loi et Vin, which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France?	0.9144805498574803
We share them with everyone on this earth.	0.48611611888050976
In point 21, Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER+ now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start.	0.9667822023727816
That is important.	0.3977722290600522
Finally, paragraph 7 emphasises that "the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" . And, in this regard, we approach the heart of the matter.	1.1261808686201802
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay, at the expense of the environment.	0.6652209687225781
Women have different individual needs and interests.	0.42715434244171907
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting.	0.3597375145749331
Secondly, LIFE is an instrument that has already produced good results, and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation.	1.0010427641813602
First: a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed.	0.8228888472038923
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated.	0.5177605586280072
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts.	1.002215980564283
It is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments.	0.8616291843896964
A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary.	0.6785594345910461
You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials. The Member States, local authorities and NGOs will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above, all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels.	0.8429833476612361
Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO.	0.533370125136889
Today, we are witnessing one of these cases, which, on the surface, may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry, but which, if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule which will cause problems for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole.	1.1612320242626624
It could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty.	0.590327354754992
Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low.	0.5117706147209895
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them.	0.9871794745275363
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.	1.01641037251827
But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival.	0.8234657844147506
This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high.	1.0128386700489895
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.	0.8850831586827267
The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China.	0.902479713324721
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs.	0.7200009878824581
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.	1.0407539139014215
This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that.	0.9309874726032129
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider' s party, the FPÖ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter.	0.8724291468402978
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes?	0.5945203380845656
We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe' s positive roles in history.	0.832787710940391
They will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars.	0.641201619612623
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention.	1.080750398266396
The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries.	0.7764933099658906
We must never forget to defend civil society.	0.3413755374020526
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text.	0.8517184707220565
How do matters stand in Kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration, the judiciary and, most importantly of all, the police force?	0.9528231825039142
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.	0.819747635283793
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions, such as education and health care.	0.841622136867304
There are concerns even within the Fifteen, concerns which may even surface again in the next decade.	0.849757969961932
Thank you, Mr Nogueira, for your explanation.	1.2067902004000564
It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all.	0.7235145772276415
Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay.	1.1823479097824408
There must therefore be measures to improve the quality and competitiveness of Europe' s tourism and, to the extent of the possible, safeguard the operation of companies.	1.1044390742999606
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance.	0.9317376328707769
I am delighted to hear the words of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in Cyprus.	1.012420963293065
This is the theory behind it, anyway.	0.6860302365009998
(Applause from the left. Heckling from the right)	0.6514774476207936
The new technologies also make it possible to open new markets in traditionally undervalued, non tourist areas, which could develop to become centres of tourism and attract substantial investments.	0.7803867886446231
I also believe that the Commission, or President Prodi, has acted as a guardian of the Treaties.	1.1251286217245402
This infatuation with strand IIIC is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that 'the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation' (p.17) and that 'the responsibilities are diffuse and vague' (p.18).	0.8766621339865606
These failings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid.	0.7885051275270943
I am counting more on the European Parliament to be not only a critical observer, as it has been in this case, but also an active player in taking the Union forward in the fight against crime.	1.1223273425460667
If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003.	0.9584169638855524
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.	0.9324823014798238
It is extremely important.	0.4886554341631938
Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors' test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud.	1.0331557799544209
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament' s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project.	0.8402732783996613
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22.	0.8719310806381451
Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention.	1.1359116567015248
The situation of Turkey's relations with its neighbours will, as the honourable Member asks, be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy.	0.9454576038419473
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing, I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way.	0.8200191780993175
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.	0.5631956358780561
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training?	0.6600302836257801
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer.	0.6594813941257017

He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	1.0999880227730594

The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds.	1.0962648000736381
To this end, I shall confine myself to stressing, out of all the choices available, the importance of three priority decisions which should, in the drawing-up of action programmes for the government of the Union, be the basis for both the Commission' s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months.	1.0551058714897004

The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats.	0.851815900541753
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.	0.6955579909476808
These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive.	0.5484105653706556
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism.	0.33472693181235347
This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.	0.7578445092489098
And when that day comes, it is too late.	0.8529756114000213
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.	0.6839190134500531
Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful.	0.9330712103132862
We want to bring this across in Parliament.	0.7800757345915288
The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image.	0.796046022143525

I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present, given his powers.	0.9925534917595724
Subject: Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status, what is the Commission's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam, given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result?	0.9838879646825613
But the source is threatening to run dry.	0.46930645780635283
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on.	0.7841266417923033
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities.	0.3561499803599393
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.	0.6762135717892698
The requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers, that is, telephones, mobile phones, Internet, etc.; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting, this is open to abuse. I would also like to ask: given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament' s in-house service?	0.9479964710987905
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement, or at the Balkans.	0.8559969546108316
As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence.	0.9192756110498205
Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.	0.7134470850939814
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.	0.7308009825007422
You can be what you want to be.	0.8369805843784586
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.	0.8526187009665893
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.	0.6622879865062434
Commissioner, I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures.	0.982586096001644
Mr President, before we begin our discussion, as an Italian MEP - and I believe I also speak on behalf of all Italian MEPs - I should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the German Chancellor, who interfered in Italian internal affairs, when he threatened that Europe would intervene if any neo-fascists became members of the government.	1.0504690137255792
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system, for example.	1.2053081180419014
I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does.	0.7352163677686538
It is true that it is a stopgap solution, but we must rely on stopgap solutions because, at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.0598908238689673
When I read Mr van Hulten' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.	0.7653538745190742
It is his first report here in plenary.	0.6552126353612194
Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue, however.	0.7122357030179804
There is, therefore a need for a fully-fledged human rights policy for and by the European Union, a policy which promotes and enforces human rights within the EU itself.	1.1255933225201655
Firstly, I believe that this directive is excessively tough, simplistic and reductionist.	1.029135261694626
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.	0.896799360217251
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.	1.1922304831624322
Are there any comments?	0.18938838462045932
In brief, the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia: to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans.	0.9740328151795923
All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.	0.9968323666663723
Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process?	0.4798773635818771
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure.	0.9191037752118754
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this.	0.7190619729354143
We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union.	0.9087814766718532
Until recently, the European countries fixed, it could be said in an autarkic way, the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets.	1.1235612763424856
In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties.	0.92877277065825
The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure, as proposed by the Commission.	1.0140850022864796
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.	0.6584501503654654
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity.	0.9634016393188858
It damages Parliament.	0.23978440768435147
Madam President, I did not want to disturb you a minute ago during the vote.	0.8786083083524188
Social rights should determine economic choices, and not the other way around.	0.990560407152966
What we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana.	0.7257151218794682
I think that, at the moment, particularly in the last few months, there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner, in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently.	1.200030499998355
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined: the exchange of confidential information.	0.8176826601071562
The proposal for a directive was amended twice, first in 1997 and then in 1998.	0.9386772585098442
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission, when it talks in terms of decentralisation.	1.0365722573066982
Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State.	1.0648853901700426
They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation.	1.0843814631341224
Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez.	0.6922620853850805
These negotiations took the form of indirect discussions mediated by the UN special representative, Álvaro de Soto.	0.5248086783401853
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent.	1.1499838665626545
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.	1.0187843386904194
On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated.	1.0782337181951476
If I had my way, I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe.	0.7612126621519683
Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament.	0.9548448257467125
What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries?	0.640884077142067
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	0.39357799385256126
On the other hand, the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us.	0.9045073726749311
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992, its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union.	1.0387388260850328
This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us, an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions, rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30, and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level, at regional level and at local government level.	0.9017688025330748
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.	0.8256499800071733
Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy.	0.8817121678923471
However, it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted.	1.0909707699945905
We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study, but we simply insist that, as this motion for a resolution points out, it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress, both on the level of states and on a general level.	1.103382914151625
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era.	0.663244719600411
We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich.	0.973488058491186
I would ask you to support this common position.	0.9286370322867351
If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe.	0.8139020834131457
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper.	0.8650064081778572
As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce.	0.8045750173727074
I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done.	0.9066613429306327
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other, which constantly takes the form of layoffs, factory closures, not to mention extensive waste of production capacity.	0.873916946919151
However, the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking.	0.7937913338050346
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament.	0.8517034097560101
So, judicially, something needs to be done.	0.7482077376656551
Hence, as Mr Karas has stated to his credit, our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax.	1.0154221324033488
It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is.	1.1570349723447377
The proposal from the Council, the common position, is that manufacturers should pay the lot.	1.0967045455932825
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling.	0.5121190404712477
I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter.	1.0035869617014557
And how should we achieve this?	0.48689739045268704
I am aware, and the previous speaker highlighted this, that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water.	1.174631331450841
Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror.	0.6683958377195909
Questions to Mrs Wallström	0.3217303264095286
But we must also preserve the original spirit of the Lomé Convention, which has enabled relations between the European Union and the ACP to become what they are today: a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect.	0.9701032960131629
How many meetings of the group have been held to date?	0.8632169630755596
I just want to outline some of the issues that we, as Socialists, have put down as amendments.	1.054494192224513
This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union.	0.7959991496941053
But, secondly, the projects will put a strain on, indeed will be injurious to, the national democracies.	0.8550296042526154
As far as that is concerned, I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome.	1.0933052931910634
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal.	1.0526049103149877
Meanwhile, on the trade side, pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention is WTO-compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangements or free-trade agreements.	0.6704980291132027
Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it.	0.9437647907350986
The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed?	0.6490187520782329
There are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe: firstly, the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road, water treatment facilities and related transport networks; secondly, the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment, which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe.	0.7525429155373611
With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar.	0.6264573527934088
However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight.	1.0794222248381669
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled? If we are, then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved.	1.0706774755246844
In addition, the Commission' s proposal puts forward special risk-spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index, a so-called index fund.	0.7817690659596098
Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area.	0.8950458491953128
In order to do so, the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament, associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society.	0.8252168240289918
This question covers several individual matters.	0.26841150069416425
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years, here in Parliament.	0.8323873201544981
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.	0.8765611437797449
It is now possible, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that the Commission will take new initiatives, and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity.	1.1592025798870043
In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion.	0.8553112827270781
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge.	0.9247978100794383
And that is what we are discussing at this late hour.	1.0549888145323296
We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports, but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared.	0.9859028151107654
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs.	0.7395502079620752
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels.	0.7957601510672815
First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor.	0.8990681236812557
Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member, Robert Goebbels, who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.	0.9030642901888222
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress.	0.9543374753476056
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.	1.0627527858402888
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)	0.43897504105870716
In the new millennium, with new global problems requiring new global solutions, they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now, rather than why it has not been done in the past.	0.9504391997162728
Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators.	0.4057122776380352
The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that, on the one hand, the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself, with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention. On the other hand, they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity.	0.8277735278951814
Apart from reducing the volume of exports from these countries to the Community market, what we term 'development aid' to the ACP has fallen constantly, from 70% of total European Union aid in 1986 to 30% in 1998.	0.9238679437898055
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.	0.7767242480167355
The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union' s cooperation policy is this: how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping.	0.7070720326741065
One can only hope that it succeeds.	0.7851645941532754
Now, more than 30 years after the inauguration of an unprecedented partnership between north and south, the tool which has proven its worth and served its time needs to be adapted in order to meet new challenges.	0.9001005932844033
Mr President, I have a few very brief comments.	1.044707035717602
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work, not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium, but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists, particularly at Council level, on issues concerning the fight against organised crime.	1.0310660588616196
They must be implemented without delay.	0.7271446860670411
They have healthy economies, high-level economic relations, and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union' s political will.	1.022521680683456
You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement.	1.009326524137581
What are the conditions for this recognition?	0.8635614811890405
Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy.	0.8649786292600603
Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission.	1.0122847351459
My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process.	1.1344708703931201
As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe' s rural heritage.	0.9203697913248421
Furthermore, I cannot stress enough the significance of our having concluded important negotiations on the new convention to succeed the Lomé Convention, and the fact that, following extremely complex and difficult negotiations, we have succeeded in organising - or making preparations for the organisation of - the first EU-Africa Summit.	1.0555354763154885
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades.	0.6558871699957238
In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then.	0.6712539098673042
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.	0.8417835972480662
At some time or another, there will be a revolt, and it will be fully justified.	1.261866441916458
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this.	0.8774817143420196
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level.	0.8487915698892955
They will be told that they are too expensive, without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services, where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas.	0.8199884227612954
I call on the Commission to act on the rapid accession of East Timor to the Lomé Convention as one means, amongst others, of promoting the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural and social development, in order to strengthen its internal democratisation.	0.9429837352341561
That the markets for production factors, including the labour market, operate flexibly?	0.8827574481858457
Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe.	0.7531380487476749
It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner.	0.8990726898977388
I. the draft Council decision amending Decision 88/591/ECSC, EEC, Euratom establishing a Court of First Instance of the European Communities (5713/1999 - C5-0020/1999 - 1999/0803(CNS))	0.6063318268764029

Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):	0.23840095476907786
A system, such as the current one, which is capable of making so few decisions, be they approvals or prohibitions, is something less than a valid system.	0.9949552163696505
For this reason, the draft reform, which has been drawn up by the rapporteur, Vice-President Marinho, is to be welcomed.	1.2020641843611388
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.	0.9400554914643364
And we must make certain that the details are applicable, appropriate and relevant to the different countries.	0.9966166316919657
For the cars currently on the road, it would be reasonable to share the cost, for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands.	1.073704836156396
After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time.	1.0902586105505054
In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia.	1.0216935077012663
Mr Tajani will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order, but I understand his political meaning.	1.1330704368092914
But early reports suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos, Tisza, Somes and Danube Rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy.	0.776801189118334
As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training - an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law.	0.9392181639412958
This is a decision of national and local government, and this is where all future decisions should be retained.	1.1208638298224731
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.	0.709767464453496
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.	0.6984388464743458
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee.	1.1046640543903674
The crisis in last year' s Commission has been solved today, but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach, which, no doubt, the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution.	1.1046749706525982
Resumption of the session	0.28538096329092966
This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation.	0.913321513653872
Some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman. Let me add to that, the importance of the post offices.	1.0126687403924857
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.	0.9436975852678929
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe.	0.7278917923738861
We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees.	0.9082866861233672
What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?	0.9476006534055871
The goal for the years to come is to increase women' s participation to achieve a rate of 40% female participation in the Marie Curie grants, in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	0.8522593777618215
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement.	0.7552478574561394
(Parliament gave its assent)Relating to Thursday:	0.39218351887978004
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy.	0.7109408086819657
They cannot therefore be approved.	0.5312077125285274
For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho.	0.9107713315559404
And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed.	1.0281570607823456
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union.	0.9651077263491356
I also call on those few Member States still harbouring reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter, for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done.	0.8634278457360764
This is true, if we think of Russia' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.	1.0778406394490503
I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda.	0.9851429583918334
These challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them.	0.6516922392237341
It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people.	1.1368182524502397
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight.	1.1524463748397424
But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse.	0.7844569752721324
We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made.	0.8245520737200523
If the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg, it could at least ensure, where flights are diverted to Basle, that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers, otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business.	0.9275885488903618
This is an arduous task.	0.767017666938602
Five months are provided for this.	0.2889671165270371
Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.	1.028396368024204
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.	0.8356972234489431
We all very much share this opinion.	0.44859054905359147
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush!	0.7382791628285215
I should also like to address two other points. We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs.	0.8767470854012075
This is not the way to fight extremism.	1.094098235628951
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.	0.8410171785939426
The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium, are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy.	1.0941281671047163
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.	0.9465440802197866
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive.	0.7336015035929855
I will give you an example.	0.7104210033744123
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.	0.7151767062092883
As you know, there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF' s financing, or rather lack of financing.	0.8198189625541443
We are, at the same time, negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe' s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide.	0.5166842036233137
We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation.	0.7333572864732826
The two processes are separate processes.	0.3992442721679535
It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.	0.9567253300998152
They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference.	1.203819723202939
I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so.	0.9440634890071824
In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be.	0.9995852222919737
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution.	0.9636613650815957
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds.	0.9014532364610851
Mr President, the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances.	0.8930314692102601
This is supposed to be our priority, would you believe.	0.8303622372957536
Rezala should never have been in France. He arrived from Algeria at a time when, according to the authorities, immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come.	0.8589405319048051
There are many opportunities to hide.	0.6450409695006183
The European Union bears a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movements, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats - because, by their dogmatic adherence to the harsh financial policies of EMU, their dislocation of the welfare state and their deification of uncontrolled competition, they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right-wing extremists of the Haider type to recruit support for their neo-Nazi ways.	0.7497786641719714
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute, which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath.	0.9300235195149962
However, there are six, seven, eight, nine perhaps, subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address.	0.7523500316859397
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects.	0.6437566015867843
With regard to what you were saying, it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council, apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note, does not actually refer to the opacity, shall we say, of the legislative process, but rather almost to an excess of transparency.	1.0810352399333176
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these.	0.8606771475735092
Clearly, we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars.	1.0315134462084676
If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject.	0.7957414151384046
According to the terms of the directive, the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned.	0.8723650007853571
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year.	0.7170273534553999
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender.	0.6737881298013223
In fact, shortly after the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, you spoke in favour of strengthening European values, creating a European ethical dimension and opening the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe.	0.8133771714835264
Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government.	0.7664351577167816
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.	0.9750609976983435
Via the structural funds, a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system.	1.0667783949072323
I hope there has been an interpretation error, and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech.	1.0001274772561108
It is downright scandalous what goes on!	0.3934430642751999
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe.	0.7998535962386707
Let us make ourselves heard!	0.5176546082053686
The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform.	1.0388885092454474
Mr Solana, it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure.	1.1066798975346233
The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing.	0.7250452271314367
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mrs Pack' s very emotionally-charged contribution.	0.565196548575103
The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management.	1.017298121453725
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation.	0.8427005728621013
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example.	0.9046413132162999
If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies, it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy.	0.8638786898240549
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative.	0.8669922315254835
(Parliament adopted the resolution)President.	0.5503079400431888
Michel Camdessus, a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference, and I am now quoting, that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other. He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries.	0.9491976918850445
I will mention only two, in order to be brief.	0.8984227984489463
In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order.	1.054163318255752
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related.	0.7364386779982341
European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings.	0.6937948052908472
It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources.	0.6100219297982499
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service.	0.696104372985993
These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe.	1.0998231473426292
I am not going to say much more on these issues.	0.7378687446383386
From now on, the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called CIRCA, to which the European Parliament will have access. This represents a real innovation, not only for us, but also - I am sure - for the Commission.	1.3626118693991414
In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system.	0.833256866627509
The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	0.6496676855444087
The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons.	0.819324117228986
An investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs, as shown particularly by the great success of LIFE, a success with NGOs, businesses, local authorities and third countries.	1.0287369157373123
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned.	0.9433118367431536
Furthermore, and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence, we demand respect for biodiversity, for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature; but at the same time, and this was apparent during recent negotiations, we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements.	0.8848245409422715
I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules.	0.8537493433178351
We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.	0.7367213554669994
It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case.	1.0837303823869824
Various arguments have been presented in its favour.	0.7222448542696946
As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service.	1.0373026811499926
I will tell you a few things we should do.	0.9102897504229934
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and, to do this, the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time.	1.2454841027589258
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.2441021597330332
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.	1.1141267358680598
We also intend to initiate a new debate, a more innovative one, on the issue of Europe' s film heritage, given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy.	1.0087902554873567
Regions which, culturally and economically, sometimes match the interest of some Member States.	0.7832915588766466
This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and, once it is implemented, will replace the financial protocols which have now expired.	1.0248424015190458
This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent.	0.7279288835640212
Is this hysteria spontaneous?	0.19706034140311057
All this is important.	0.8625764574954542
The Financial Regulation should be amended.	0.7260158030727305
Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.	0.7065037491245179
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness, the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.	0.6942543288293906
This has been talked about for years.	0.6331676759428629
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this.	0.8243288798212467
So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines.	0.3976109752511161
They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.	0.6314746675777084
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission.	1.361691686912427
This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner.	0.8919697719029284
Note that this proposed tax, which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people, would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation. Yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere.	0.8482235255643196
We certainly have done our share to solve that problem, and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement.	1.013098330909257
The Community initiative means community involvement.	0.6029912921228944
During the months that I have been working on this report, one very clear demand has emerged, both from industry and from those who represent the consumer.	0.9755735902579459
This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level.	0.6866757734439335
The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves.	0.6345590930109336
Is this speculative?	0.31077399625403235
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.	1.0034262463356716
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.	1.0074332595316697
The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work, of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices.	0.983848048879774
Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.	0.8525178420328411
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution.	0.8557102410312936
The intervention prices have been regulated, and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support.	0.8194132913274341
In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success, as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components.	0.925207105086828
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings.	0.944663260815656
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels?	0.2807855678288151
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view.	1.4305740187873353
Let us call this a negative tender franchise.	0.4167437100119139
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists.	1.146044763747065
I also abstained for another reason. I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be.	0.8556573393627432
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme.	0.9328283849388906
(DA) Mrs Cederschiöld' s report reflects an extremely peculiar form of logic. The EU introduces a common currency.	0.9226610907465482
Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes.	0.2920854736170103
The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water, coastal waters, inland waters and groundwater.	0.9277167305959056
Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report.	0.9854964736255842
Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used.	0.6594788847480645
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III, the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding.	0.7203206980496113
We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough.	0.9966366684590273
The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves.	0.7298963533865779
Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995.	0.7540072199992425
Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed.	0.5822819681157121
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included.	1.1054711598893714
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.	0.7652016459143282
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.	0.48739100248313216

I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way.	0.9302237000280444
The world' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used, for example, for a variety of well-meaning, UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them.	0.8483964164153814
Future generations of women must not be sidelined.	0.7038986522559845
Obviously, the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III.	1.2427685113056417
I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks.	0.9982182962294412
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole.	0.8053761343074138
What are the Council's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	0.6095583794928844

Question No 51 by (H-0049/00):	0.2706890689933201
We must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years!	0.5849101462712369
Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group.	1.2854345768735023
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct.	0.7739397223626453
Relatively few women, however, are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies.	0.5782985497738725
I am pleased to see, however, that under LEADER+, new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development.	0.9080287453557474
Mr President, Mr Alavanos' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues.	0.7273207346175252
We need specific proposals, both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies.	0.9655575959017704
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come.	0.7341389190369413
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission.	0.7209909196655188
We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March.	0.9435023310185436
Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind.	1.0882530556106444
I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields.	0.7938555154646298
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection.	0.6071170525965781
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes.	0.5644614933201623
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.39240586653689646
Madam President, Commissioner, the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature.	0.9277267548722998
I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties.	0.7598840419863883
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	0.368817285321533
We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies.	1.002105794534856
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.	0.6954742655974072
The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest.	0.7889829463829884
Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security.	0.7314003065042841
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity.	0.7412871136313874
Secondly, Cuba.	0.7056635571622666
What we have here is an ecological disaster.	1.1178331451394934
This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.5564014195888268
Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.	0.8347861717403184
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.	1.1079096559417123
Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts. We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole.	1.0100938909712396
Secondly: a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark.	0.760731370842249
In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case.	0.6771661492055447
I think, therefore, that vintage cars ought to be exempt.	0.7351718090844297
And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership.	0.8717813703201029
This is what we should be concerned about here today.	0.9893814366538347
What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks?	0.8224543410819264
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved, even silent, specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed.	0.839594732478298
What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days.	0.6983992910673713
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far.	0.526766477405324
It is therefore not out of the question that these issues, which crop up again and again, and which are passed from one conference to another, may be addressed.	1.2400003203315864
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively.	0.8760896284920244
My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies, who should be working together rather than against one another.	0.7991384123673586
We disagree with many of the report' s views.	0.9420513020532914
Securing this is a major priority.	1.0596010937916067
In the meantime, it is nature that is taking the rap, as always.	0.8257299085931967
I hope that this will be of benefit.	1.1725276054921867
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss.	0.5337488103873353
Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject.	0.8132318262425782
The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and, in the Netherlands, a value of 86% recycling has now already been achieved.	0.7875218589663614
I therefore believe that the European Union must, to start with, carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe.	0.9902032911295753
The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry.	0.4497529134807134
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire.	0.9492447959323057
Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.	0.8107387097348858
Deviating from the Council' s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water.	0.7492682999356156
Nevertheless, the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us.	0.8639378881192158
We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things.	1.1246052187930125
My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union.	1.087094020179788
For ten years you represented democratic Czechoslovakia and, later, the Czech Republic, as its president.	0.8613794393454985
Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams, even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue.	0.6831662322376109
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical.	1.1100505589496823
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions.	0.9157686507111907
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community.	0.6714394974795223
What measures does the Council intend to adopt, and when, with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks, the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability?	0.9046917242007879
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years, but you have not done so for the CFP, with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context, in the context of globalisation.	1.1369870735088512
NATO is largely European.	0.34740602605255155
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy.	0.867946649817796
In any case, the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect.	1.3757332100882445
For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding.	0.7377275641966791
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible.	0.7719814581510926
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium.	0.6694666252994099
If you are, when exactly are you going to do it?	1.0891848542307916
This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future.	0.7021973066526186
The lynch mob and their extreme right-wing mentors are the mortal enemies not only of the workers, but of society as a whole.	0.8754533837855639
Many European cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high-added-value activities and high-income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes, high unemployment, substandard and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency.	0.5912659365626607
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance, not only between the different countries or the different components, but especially between the different groups listed in the programme, and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date.	1.2460525048864923
It is for life.	0.8083569757909671
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported.	0.7038811882585169
Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States.	0.796810569458885
I would urge Parliament to support them.	0.8094822974716864
This directive encourages the whole of this sector.	0.8603288937763549
This is also about respecting a culture, a language, a way of life and a people' s religion, a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared.	1.1370662201441433
That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.	0.9803226497461772
All those aspects should be part of a rationale, a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights.	0.9865497689050383
We need more dialogue, not just with each other but also with civil society.	1.1507041711044794
In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission.	0.8720633017419626
I have taken note of your words; this is something which we all feel very deeply.	1.0503183452901326
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others, which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start.	1.029559983604237
I will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7. It is quite simple: a special heading, namely, the famous heading 7, was created in Berlin, as part of the large Agenda 2000 package, for the applicant countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which are currently undergoing a process of transformation, and for these countries alone.	1.18046202567277
She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release.	0.9553463703879013
I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March.	0.612022887410218
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up, but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure.	1.1918151059168753
I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court. This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission.	1.2989091840073321
I hope that, once again, this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much.	1.0290978102439698
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.	0.8465301146135644
In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women.	0.8133287120759722
No European society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other.	0.7246960114093871
Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans.	0.6770658199927515
Let us point out that Parliament' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them.	0.659747759317574
While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties, there is a dark side to the picture as well.	0.8272203461694523
There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies.	1.2201878284567869
This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future.	1.129055805121345
I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector.	1.0840146195557896
Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service.	1.0647445713543477
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable.	0.7718746915737003
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that.	0.781604210893739
This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn.	1.0705973321408617
I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement, none of which unfortunately lasted, between the parties to the conflict.	0.7234254740399003
On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion.	1.1627316054298018
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member.	0.7225456990264336
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world.	0.8305334352708964
Expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union, after agriculture and the Structural Funds.	0.8088385351153353
Many speakers have underlined this.	0.3632824215903704
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission.	0.7056290168379165
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.	0.3636360671412504
Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading.	1.1809731584366683
In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies.	1.1246815261702636
We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues, a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others.	1.1255255677986693
A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible.	1.0245145965359672
We see enlargement as a process of partnership, not a process of "them and us".	0.7899734117327807
That is something we would do well to recognise.	0.891629339973051
Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state, in their respective working programmes, that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries, but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence.	1.185396138459462
According to the general regulations, however, any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20, and not Article 23.	0.9475242719547592
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select.	0.8414832535663644
With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments, we may have a great deal of control, but it is inefficient control.	0.7841871629539389
This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection.	0.8173087084883341
And as international financial activity speeds up, the risks increase.	0.7435199561670283
In 1910, a woman' s right to vote was on the agenda.	0.8955490056051084
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.	0.6806004941753492
So, for example, the island of Réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia.	0.8171693823828137
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate, 'necessarily with acute vigilance' .	0.8827592714648166
I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability.	1.046144320550718
Secondly, it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment.	0.9458435948904172
Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace.	1.2680935487536333
Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women.	0.9406568113430779
Forgeries are big business.	0.26244568821071845
Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on.	1.0761659810051476
This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States, a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds.	0.9325529543052705
We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible.	0.9487239210964566
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions. This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers, producers and industry generally.	0.6526048684087805
Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic' s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified.	0.8659611638869518
My country' s place is not outside the European Union but in it ...	0.707588689629344
That did not happen.	0.4896897518530422
This is the change we must impose on the Commission' s action.	0.7699989517340765
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.	1.0281826930394855
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	0.5809650884869187
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit, thus preparing for the future.	0.8254091930465776
With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater.	0.7494916354127731
We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process.	0.6366889205309587
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system.	0.8146253748198395
Do not forget that, in the case of cars, 80% of environmental impact comes through driving, 1% through recovery and 19% through construction.	0.895476951100987
The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle.	0.5925208068092502
Our relationship with Armenia, as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year, is of course one element in these foreign relations.	0.8802196618216647
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.	0.9295547729903192
They belong in the legislative text. I might do the same if I were a Commissioner, because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament, which takes so long and is so difficult.	1.1515045280134857
Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk.	0.5040209458313969
Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of 'non-refoulement' [no turning back].	0.6362134718417629
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will surely rally behind this proposal.	0.9199775442758638
I am not going to mention the length of this report.	0.8805484862969714
In my opinion, Mr President, this joint debate fully bears this out.	0.8735396891440805
We will raise that, too, in the representations we make.	0.7163868644665806
We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now.	0.6504469380932982
Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin' s 'anti-terrorist' operation in Chechnya.	0.5386034135544356
As such, I would ask you to give OLAF' s work your full support, also in its present form.	0.8625954840209691
That being so, I believe the final result will be better.	1.1371514336920054
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.	0.675558432352793
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion.	0.6928037605699011
Mr President, just before I went down into the Chamber, I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives.	0.7060530581556486
The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex.	1.0433884005906187
We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities, who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops.	0.8433944565197926
However, I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion, but also paragraph 10.	0.9750172952353796
According to the experts, Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life, and this should be a standing committee, not elected, presumably made up of another group of experts.	1.1106781542475923
Under the banner of "progress towards transparency" , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public.	0.6641195922998753
I have two further points to make on this process.	0.8331364505980013
In these areas, Europe' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity.	0.7624128271032637
As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the European Parliament.	0.8973483836496101
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation.	0.781819816249894
Bearing this in mind, this House should, in any event, demand that, before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved, they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.	1.1335711929874466
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.	0.7485265937206594
I am not one of those MEPs who thinks that it is essential to adopt "extremist" amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the Council of Ministers.	0.8282651637623375
Then it is possible to understand that, for example, lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy, and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are, of course, bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context.	0.7508411013361528
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others.	0.94769689031292
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being, if the mandate that our President, Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe' s citizens is to be effective, our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.	1.027371967759961
Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century.	0.8411216092214153
One area that I want to focus on, in addition to those already identified, is that of cultural diversity in Europe.	1.1131845752739853
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action, among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social, as well as economic, development of a people.	0.9677437010402127
It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications.	0.9010343306756059
We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so.	1.0002755103907046
The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place.	0.8064323538508555
These countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003.	0.8641923462950883
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information, and that the global economy will, in the future, rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital.	1.0176077848191831
Vaclav Havel stated that, in Eastern Europe, the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society: national movements, churches and the independent trade unions.	0.7086124449446692
Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe: "Nevertheless, this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions".	0.9252645683913875
Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.	1.0722311111043805
It can only approve Member States' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria: firstly, integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships, whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account; secondly, the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local, regional and national authorities, training institutions, universities, NGOs, the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership, and thirdly, methods and models of indisputably innovative character.	0.9063582483632162
In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations.	0.7167276819690364
In that year, we voted against granting discharge.	0.8811032653249644
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region, as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations, will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process.	1.0999133018842897
Madam President, although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support, introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union, as the first area of the world to do so, would sound the death knell for the European currency markets.	1.0805510182606164
Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality.	1.0151488685922396
We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria.	0.7222478864419548
The strength of the FPÖ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility.	0.8844036114147625
In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities.	0.8485941578042637
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.	0.6167606445841722
First part	-0.0
Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.	0.9095818753922106
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene.	1.1164866547076524
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.	1.0666712853482805
All that remains for me to say is: time to get down to business.	0.8794670285735833
In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too.	1.1234965165522215
For many years, I have tried, through the Council and the Commission, to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in, and working for, conflict resolution in the Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco.	1.2227377943657238
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.	0.8556698258025317
For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chevènement.	0.9762582145774116
There is in particular one amendment, let me point out, concerning the energy sector, which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important.	1.0825976465174607
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.	0.8797341246434136
We must meet these challenges together.	0.4235289753192783
I am thinking in particular of countries such as Cuba which are isolated but I know, because I have travelled there extensively, that the Cubans who come into contact with tourists can learn something of the outside world, obtain different information and pass on different information.	0.8351538607163126
But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.	0.6763814783252371
One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately.	0.715036753377978
We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR.	0.873286634250094
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):	0.265453150600503
The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today.	0.8602209097707709
I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal' s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion.	1.007710653597643
As far as I am concerned, that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here.	0.8899876982348838
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted.	0.9604461741844287
I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November.	0.9994220394072819
In the autumn the Commission will report back on the progress made in this respect.	1.069657191054801
Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates.	1.082453751181177
I will keep myself free in this connection.	0.6514231878252381
A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic.	0.42544563530460816
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate.	0.7880726898934627
In this respect too, I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies, specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being submitted.	1.288804127216724
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country.	0.6542598845141194
I can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector.	0.7465329203302324
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.	0.9915742102838798
As manufacturers are responsible for the design, they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase.	1.051916048291895
In the Commission, systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred.	0.5411204233344215
To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done.	1.1219077441154222
An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it.	0.9426159788981743
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective, and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, are on the verge of despondency precisely because, since matters are improving, there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent.	0.8998809618862045
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty.	0.8391343327873735
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000.	0.8856592450169971
On the other hand, despite his declarations on humanity and peace, it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that, according to the Helsinki resolutions, we intend to set up a terrorist army, starting with 60 000 men, in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet.	0.8585242861166705
The general agreement between both institutions in this field must not keep the Commission from following the most pragmatic approach in achieving our common objectives.	0.6442413678166538
This has an impact of course, because it is read by other members of the Council.	0.9170252052406012
In addition, experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that, apart from rather dubiously creating jobs, they are not of any great benefit.	0.7221428260789056
I can assure you here today that the Commission, in exercising its risk management functions, will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority.	1.0932981314520622
It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management.	0.5245233404585021
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme.	0.944074625723491
I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.	1.096343395859713
I think that Mrs Lienemann' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council.	1.0189572271377463
Clearly, they have no role to play in your strategy.	1.0399438652821682
In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term.	1.0108295919157493
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.	0.7366051246960341
It is remarkable that, now they have the opportunity to do so, none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union.	0.7780996330790141
This is an important aspect of this initiative.	1.1208049459730582
But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba.	1.0543169125256002
But where will you place the emphasis?	0.31279116553376374
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.	1.1634967141520434
I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not.	0.8134175502792349
Mr Alavanos, I see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited.	0.9484653592231236
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that.	0.5029966384814147
How will these people be selected?	0.4023985251994229
And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require.	0.8697601630731376
The Commission' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence.	0.6615377342184522
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations.	0.7832333987752468
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime.	0.8441752200488203
And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products.	0.6155400230644988
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it.	0.6783445792219294
Indeed, expansion, globalisation, a sharp increase in the ageing population, individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable.	0.6968207615877938
I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems, because they are not liquid, the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks.	0.87518839442417
Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships.	0.6719148913083642
They see land being fought over, medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted, books for schools - but not at all in the least-developed areas of our world, 50% of the world's population never making a telephone call in their whole life.	0.9369439881617738
Mr President, you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands.	1.1888206327680544
I believe in a social market economy based on a successful market operating subject to certain rules intended to guarantee the general interest. Specifically, at the moment, this means the protection of investors.	0.9396181575990797
The insertion of Article 13, which was referred to during the debate, dealing with non-discrimination in the Treaty establishing the European Community, is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the Treaties.	1.0606558208595058
The vote will take place on Thursday.	0.5545025420944523
It now appears that this desire is more serious.	0.589666450244235
I want to emphasise that, as early as 1997, the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer' s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position.	1.2492256029482234
It is easy to counterfeit the euro.	0.3457494333320881
Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential. And, since it should be essential, I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training.	1.1656460007826055
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work.	0.7915949627655915
However, I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force, bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997.	1.0827945809994435
In this area we must respond to public opinion.	0.8850066890764445
The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7.	1.1179265280184458
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation.	0.8170026496472634
On the availability of the studies, - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999.	0.8820976403259468
(PT) The Commission' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity, given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States.	0.929791443586326
In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties.	0.909686096733826
However, the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions, such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam, the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar, and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member States to common directions, priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice.	0.8375851818788755
Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?	0.7755009130985122
The document mentions common values on different occasions.	0.46830869064412906
Personally, I am rather in favour of the term "EU service provision card" which is proposed in Amendment No 1, but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this.	0.9831246757463697
Whatever system is adopted, ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer.	0.7211372241993285
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake.	0.7900475797602767
We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States.	0.5610484774296148
There are, however, one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific.	0.9415839556604985
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel, you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party' s summit meeting.	1.0028911167730534
Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day.	0.745285832661926
We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments' ability to act and within the scope of the Council.	0.9357835772409325
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms.	0.274006451603428
This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott.	0.6260856252010667
Some of our working practices need radical reform.	0.6082972889132469
The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights...	0.9037113082843586
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.	0.6694831370556311
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy.	0.6717915602568825
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements.	0.9179274427524962
This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot, therefore, be approved.	0.8744998483488131
Not to save jobs.	0.2773126815063135
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.	1.0120095275455574
It also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right. Unless we achieve real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk.	1.0874114000487718
We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise.	0.7934453952716082
I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today.	1.0085600147097384
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.7519038252812191
However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements.	0.9681931699542451
Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda.	1.0259758754860289
Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament, and it may well be that, with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture, problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict: cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned.	1.1022841604297513
However, as politicians we must ask the question why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPÖ at the elections in October 1999.	0.9512357287951032
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe' s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy.	0.6020848540467716
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty, some of them very old, which are still referred to as EC.	1.0741353447454813
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt.	0.92765851489311
We are setting the Commission a massive task, not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard.	1.1668731155824634
They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police.	0.5422661847169891
On the contrary, I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM' s relations with all its neighbours.	0.7370627515774097
We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them.	0.8557359288208329
Since the Belgian Government' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken, it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message, a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial.	0.8579773155620152
The implementation of the directive on statistics aims at improving the knowledge of market structures and trends in European tourism and its industry.	0.8295072682223591
A legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies, to coordinate and to programme, all vital factors for making European Union tourism competitive with other markets.	0.7879595414928572
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.	0.8447639025777515
The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis.	0.728561984245331
By pitching the percentage level at 5%, which is now likely to be the case, it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage.	0.8603270089269326
In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.	1.0044733723266108
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism.	0.8000650623054848
In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be introduced.	0.5693583638986623

He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations.	0.8320735266277792
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public.	1.2717357278705852
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic.	0.7181678624402862
As these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control, the risks are all the more obvious.	0.8576238603513704
This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative.	0.7446189262314088
It is obvious that mainly local and regional - and, therefore, to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy.	0.9366350475865529
The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.	0.6966903780387765
Additionally, European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists.	0.8227672725909352
When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks.	0.9748851696753891
The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me.	0.7287378639480012
I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders.	0.5601300671512631
Mr President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer.	0.8582130633744294

However, in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis.	1.0933530354246428
My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well.	0.9366791719630285
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.	0.50696345278312
Lastly, I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura: his knowledge, his sense of balance, his intellectual qualities, make him, in my opinion, the best possible rapporteur this report could have had.	0.89811569863232
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields.	1.0433439066461323
We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April.	0.6795535269379503
Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance.	0.905258795418487
Certain amendments concern improvements to the Commission' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed.	0.9818147614740157
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons.	0.7102309341800495

Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States.	0.8575193532521374

I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields.	0.8033979080029691
With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the European Parliament had long wanted - to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure.	1.0176502400458312
Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny. When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good, as you can imagine.	0.8939202554026051
I would like more information on this, because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services.	0.996094707833656
Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.	1.2474298144008316
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers.	0.5622821448312811
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition.	0.7193370653229462
The discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors.	0.6036846880112237
Which is why the new 20-year agreement due to be signed in Fiji on 31 May represents more than the simple renewal of the Conventions regulating relations between Europe and the ACP.	0.760601141389594
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope.	0.5493295269538865
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.	0.6819477554430843
However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.	0.8752477969941711
The people are holding demonstrations, they are sending us e-mails.	0.6561564288174324
In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lomé Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle.	1.1446644443224463
On the one hand, the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought. On the other hand, if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies, then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed.	0.9492420930694839
Finally, I welcome the Commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets.	1.140196075748707
We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now.	0.9761242172123727
Madam President, I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders.	0.8395061302253453
I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service, even if our post offices operate like businesses.	0.8809442927499914
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.	1.1683690026921614
There should therefore be a universal application: it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.	0.983226844988032
Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system?	1.0032384502782032
Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.	0.8607209768394508
The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament.	0.934012900696968
And, in this regard, you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people' s social conditions, which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls.	0.9497129850420915
Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors.	0.6598650731954282

There are many interesting questions relating to it, the monitoring centre, the principle of concentration etc. However, I would like to concentrate on the management bodies.	0.8657365537769298
The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid.	1.0495483855964352
That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries.	0.9559574034355229
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary.	0.6873705515862121
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.	0.9178652510738333
I would therefore urge the Council' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and, above all, to conclude it in such a way that we all of us, including the people of Europe, realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide.	1.0990371968601238
I sincerely hope, in conclusion, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes.	0.9142153756670909
And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle.	1.1983113174945035

Madam President, in the heat of the moment I forgot to mention that, in my report on the excessive deficit procedure, the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the Spanish version.	1.05213606577452
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.	0.5400775709761928
Mr President, this morning' s debate is very important.	1.228336587380387
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed, the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems.	0.5911739943518324
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.	0.8352530837492292
In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.	0.7645026458999591
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end, to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.	1.3181082424227744

You have mentioned Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes, but there are, as you know, several Community actions to combat AIDS, and in this respect, you are right, and the United States will probably not do any better.	1.1629117316882154
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes.	0.7135137792023148
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures.	0.7992254625297085
The European Commission' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes.	0.8002622277799185
. (PT) The Portuguese Presidency is particularly interested in this issue, as I suppose that this is the first time a presidency has made resolving the problem of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament a priority in its programme.	1.0877165961070694
In my opinion, it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas.	0.9509624171159797
We need a timetable, by all means, but a more gradual timetable.	1.0815079389389286
I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the "what is to be done" variety.	0.8843058838742759
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.	0.8679104501166384
Thus, a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles, to encourage private sector recycling companies, through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements, and to incentivise the use of recycled materials.	0.9487275321880526
A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will, therefore, be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management.	0.7323119011446623
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed.	0.8365665098296364

This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.	0.9192919570000352
Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision.	0.8044532212197452

Macedonia did not go through a war.	0.570911777998016
I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women.	0.9865068292165706
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.	0.7862818030184473
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say.	0.6879975187770773
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.	0.9557345943999076
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper.	0.7130676813018633

The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic, social, and infrastructural measures.	0.8411938697290953
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster?	0.9752100551535178
This approach and its scope, which the Commission can in principle approve, are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47.	1.0332645688614328
For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases.	0.7938780945131726
Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system.	0.9486494830053689
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned.	1.0068717387057378
The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this.	0.9778888641258849
For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees.	1.2000792077425242

I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy, and that this monitoring centre' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies, but should also cover Member States' actions and policies, including the actions of economic groups, which I think are also important.	1.0356711316348588

It has not, however, been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle.	0.8511649414487398

What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw?	0.6461375791317653
A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field.	1.0456818751871608
However, I must make two essential points. These concern the simplification and application of Community law.	1.0038377349343879
However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security.	1.0211983656736001
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist.	1.0497528817079826
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.	1.0031709115705847
Uniformity needs to be worked on.	0.4022070438013788
My Group has signed a joint resolution with EPP and UEN, in which, however, we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names.	0.9694948509638344
It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be.	0.8241460055146412
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.	0.9985182165834415
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation.	0.4993803573443705
Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force.	0.964579226922911
Do we have any figures?	0.6903772835250583

Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services?	0.7117907704251434
By means of this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society.	0.9724296689246007
Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce.	0.9804319889223116
These are of long standing, but are being addressed already within NATO.	0.9105798970870929
Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance.	1.0554607322785272
At the same time, it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries, and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty.	0.9520477984180726
As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition.	0.9226517444451174
How are priorities supposed to be set here?	0.7721226188292507
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services.	0.7031431280008745
On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability.	0.926716148591936
Mr President, I would like, in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau.	1.024753338383629
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question.	0.9671250248626231
The ÖVP (Austrian People's Party), whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted, is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria.	0.7321871727385886
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House.	1.101868011270164
If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom.	0.837936357117614
However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place.	0.7997301222428184
Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission.	0.9587960790367156
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion.	0.6467590884317467
This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion.	0.5035949096365806
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6325170089974864
Moreover, I have taken note of the request made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text, once it has been approved - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment No 22 of the second proposal.	1.056561365168789
Here, then, I want to point out that international competition is tough and, if we are to overcome it positively, we must together envision and share a long-term strategy.	0.9424434577586173
I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria.	0.9799647224206536
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria.	0.5597126298593053
It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests.	1.1162105067481298
With global markets, we need global employment laws and global subsidies.	0.8267610427005515
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.	1.1442497741102509
Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents.	1.119801318183366
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes, particularly in third countries, without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing.	0.9633075210161739
At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties.	0.9741171287956208
Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China.	0.8616997164893614
So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention.	0.6256118884602409
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play, i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system.	0.9927929692208318
I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support.	1.04213446007792
Mr President, this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life.	0.9765588489800173
These feeder funds exist in the United States, which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system.	0.9070871039780893
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening.	0.5614224300957497
I hope that next time, also if any other airline company is involved, things will run more smoothly.	0.8459159006945222
The European market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems.	0.5914750955789293
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me.	0.8484483146168131
When the Commission' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change.	0.8116522449405974
The other parties are not paying.	0.460679759006021
Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.	1.0214593531525415
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to.	0.7937236993597333
You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union' s enlargement on our structural policy.	0.7796202431340931
I understand your concern about the rights of children.	0.8262739794078541
Of course, she is entirely correct in saying that the Union' s credibility is on the line with what happens, not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole.	0.9931654818991829
Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty.	0.8710238487228221
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties, and understand why this situation arises.	0.9293427412595644
The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders.	0.9466953661502844
It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life.	0.8382078826226287
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly.	0.9036373400993387
So ACP cooperation remains very exciting, and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention.	1.3211703430630317
Regarding URBAN, I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention, first of all, the selection procedure.	0.9366311797897108
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law.	0.8938124705725932
Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry?	0.612978006665859
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax, but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue.	0.9513308024315159
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn.	0.6734456601082295
Without presuming to lecture you - God forbid - or even advise you, may I just point out that, when it was my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country, I saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people? Each week, when engaging in this dialogue in each region, I realised that there was a real need for the European Union to have a face.	1.0366650180348518
In this area we have to work with the world as it is, and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation.	1.149455108227369
The European Parliament was the first to speak up.	1.3052134507129898
However, in this regard I share Mr Salafranca' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week, namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe.	0.922492357398969
Journalists, on the other hand, who are simply going about their work in Russia, i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible, are being treated like criminals.	0.9170221383673995
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels, we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications.	0.9463448827687702
As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals.	0.8704469952663131
We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.	0.9160059789352051
Their reports are extremely detailed and very important.	0.4488396282361956
Some parts of the proposal have been criticised, among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants, as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	0.6871662026348369
That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term.	1.0499405815400178
Please note that Mr Michel Raymond, Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment.	0.7981995166847715
How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective?	1.2990158171365391
Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because, in the final analysis, we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union?	0.8790107615312369
True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system.	1.2084156079931212
Madam President, in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement.	1.2942923316410133
So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999.	1.0502795092731587
We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe.	0.5412462350661263
I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning, in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission.	1.1032089483409615
For me as a Finn, and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals, it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals.	0.9018571996774802
The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development.	1.0149011147014135
This is why we urge the Commission, in this sharp and clear resolution, to develop specific instruments.	1.1826264809798028
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.	0.8872988867142444
This is part of the solution.	0.5898417683510303
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.	0.4779017712861303
Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.	0.6852889897745557
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.5600374368347253
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of?	0.8138015399091937
We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies, regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term, some of the homeless may be dead, will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union.	1.075575599929161
As I have also said before to this House, the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty.	1.2657597347893406
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics.	0.5838984659145233
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters.	0.9254055693812117
In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model.	0.8527227786950644
In the course of my speech, I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made.	0.8915892508827581
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.	0.6372791610965975
It is the Member States, however, who will have to implement this directive, and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions, the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland.	0.9092276964660289
In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.	0.8439349446273703
Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.	1.125553761784781
These are what are missing.	0.5332515695607828
If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that.	0.9178804917065043
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.	0.5989473521027819
Mr President, there are economic frontiers within the European Union, and the internal market with the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is fully operating at this time.	0.9176518995359012
We vote against this report, because by allowing trans-border interception of telecommunication and reversing the burden of proof, the Convention will create the legal ground for large scale bugging operations in the EU.	0.9019378631792428
Although there is this disagreement, I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe.	0.981020185220135
Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided, following the example of previous presidencies, to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue.	1.0638714791571002
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development, combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes.	1.0118673212209073
They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria.	0.6762546439698887
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.	1.0209237371129933
A fair and, indeed, generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East.	0.8586663311666918
Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties?	0.8273936604154531
It is far too prescriptive.	0.6909071148005469
According to the experts, few of these complete cars are of no value.	0.6789649756662167
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate. It is like so much European legislation.	1.1228379381325067
This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations - still premature - for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy.	1.0860097386696344
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof.	0.938524114684323
It is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail.	0.8347625692972902
The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised.	0.6256979999609061
I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support.	0.9759938106164835
Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic.	0.8804605079733308
. (SV) Thank you, Mrs Schörling.	0.874482606263658
The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs.	0.7379877224097681
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region.	0.7584755099944244
However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis.	0.9512304028928746
With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate, the application of tariffs, the Spanish Socialists have been arguing, in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay, that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption.	1.0538173631426957
Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future.	1.139111254189563
According to its President, it is in a position to do so.	0.9418699693600243
I believe it is only a coincidence, but the Commissioner for the Environment is also, of course, to participate in this group.	1.3220940458134995
However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.	0.9435411415198117
These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects.	0.8565886149107231
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead.	0.8961588648958043
The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million.	0.9484684689587687
Social protection should be an expression, first and foremost, of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost, exclusively in fact, under the jurisdiction of the nation state.	0.7874929116926426
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	0.8128930110421011
Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference.	0.9653150414162508
If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far, I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do.	0.9035656686188328
There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive.	0.9992492044297088
What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government. It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.	1.0434771499343125
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour.	0.6299850280529667
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.	0.8744916809390838
The Commission' s response has been as follows: firstly, the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding.	0.7022364395115483
Recently, because of political developments in Austria, there is growing unease within Europe. Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue.	0.9132323358850735
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one' s friends unfortunately still exists.	0.5164947754191244
And what about vehicles which are already on the road?	0.8450673774798847
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.	1.2564068993178128
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us.	1.2753247970241777
The level of aid is naturally important, and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased.	1.141933526578216
In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative.	0.695476821809399
The French text contains the word "refuse" and the English text the word "shall" , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public, for example in my own country.	0.9302793236231388
Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight.	0.858455033900142
In the end, it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens.	0.9603482844303776
Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise.	0.9387096624526059
It is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions, since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions.	0.7365712775993716
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened.	0.8987813081322404
There is a limit to how useful that is.	0.6577743443877947
The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy, so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy.	0.8679389498127097
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future?	0.9305279670262256
It is not only the targeted, specific tourism actions which are important but the other horizontal actions in the field of transport.	1.010040322644159
In explaining my vote, I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water, but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe, but will lead to legislative caricature.	1.1724319560078573
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent, understandable and flexible.	0.9358771993440119
That means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from Community legislation, as it should, but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years.	0.9315374012609631
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard.	1.2262402876327574
If they yield, they are lost.	0.7723589991695448
This Parliament is excluded from this, for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility.	0.8674747077629101
The after-shocks can still be felt.	0.45981506251790505
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law.	1.1286499800136227
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.	1.1539822173192373
Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure.	0.9212369977714192
In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe.	0.9996459070393492
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations.	1.076343969942106
We are very anxious indeed that the EU, too, should move in this direction, and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	0.9809452108360464
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.	0.6182740047387947
Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria, in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than, say, the three most successful countries in this matter?	0.972760016490804
From that point of view, neither local governments and much less non-governmental organisations, for example the farming cooperatives which would be interested in further development of the farming sector, have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third Community Support Framework, nor have they had any involvement in the previous CSFs.	0.8706196077503376
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched?	0.9427243039690596

I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.	0.925863586428961
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.	0.7611342056312956
The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House. This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency.	0.8946295134816686
The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article.	0.9813888845460547
What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice.	0.9542716094320463
The main risk is that the Commission, without adequate justification, might upset the balance which exists now by proposing to go swiftly on to a second phase of liberalisation which would, in some countries, throw off balance the funding of the universal postal service, making it unmanageable.	0.8439970515686219
It is of inestimable importance that people in Europe, as well as in the rest of the world, should have the opportunity to experience each other' s ways of ordering their lives and their societies.	0.856351859270049
It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial.	0.6994238340740093
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems.	0.9380974515952833
In addition to that, there is the question of duty-free.	1.0077479328783567
We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive.	1.0070206925329315

This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.	1.1403911990109732
Accessible higher education, with which you have a certain affinity, is an important instrument in the emancipation of population groups. I am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the Protestant university in Amsterdam.	1.0836317921265368
I should, however, like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie.	0.6587645593931569
In light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the UN, is it not about time you abandoned your traditional, conservative views on refugees and immigrants?	0.7792514557413021

I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development.	0.669739446130136
This unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy.	0.9802020085351317
Mr MacCormick, first of all, I would like to answer your comments.	0.6709618801657933
I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and, finally, in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border, transregional and interregional cooperation.	0.876996151050099
I would urge you to endorse this.	0.6248401948718642
I also want to add that, when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities, I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules. I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances.	0.8927832956786593
Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.	0.8105086315887043
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind, it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful.	1.0119140617076605
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate?	0.8842226563741692

It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.	1.2741186123274864
Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, at a time when, to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report, "the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries, especially the poor" , the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries, albeit with a transitional period of several years, instead of strengthening it, especially for the poorest countries.	1.028918148300296
This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa.	0.7996870009642528
Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.	1.1259635351472184

(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)	0.6831952725573531
The Commission' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware.	1.2048774077569964
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence.	1.0452127293504019

That has never been the intention.	0.5225794723888173
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us.	0.7709625490003507
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this.	0.7599511421322737

To guarantee transparency and prudence, investments in non-harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria, for example a transparency requirement and investor protection, are introduced.	0.6597387498515784
The widely quoted Article 7 of the Treaty, which provides for the repeal of membership rights from a Member State where serious and continuous violations against human rights have been established, is, of course, only a kill or cure remedy, an ultimum remedium, which, in the case of Austria, can only be quoted in the absence of anything more effective, and by way of warning.	0.9526408574758278
There is a willingness but fear pervades, and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union.	0.8651786089041333
This new move follows on from the step taken at the Helsinki European Council last December, when it was decided that Malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in February 2000, i.e. by the end of this month, in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the Union and the adjustments required.	0.8066024819067379
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future. In other words, what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves, what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide?	0.9997576607675293
This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances.	0.9234525860847459
Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today.	0.9258393248224072
As this is the first Valentine' s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease, the biggest killer in the European Union.	1.1139415612896288
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens, about public debates.	0.7465154973256866
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE.	1.054775173476668
After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms.	0.8019793034357563
Madam President, the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005. These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict.	0.9632087958309142
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio' s reports.	0.7575101757674216
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market, creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed.	0.6744713429634789
In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are.	1.0825557067601785
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment.	1.1424875231671316
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo' s speech set here.	0.8019271025722077
The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.	1.0305140696033044
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.	0.7578856635250939
We have made progress in recent months and weeks, as Mr Gama mentioned earlier.	1.0846552158265264
Why not?	-0.0
There is no point in second-guessing or trying to second-guess our intentions.	0.7564154952137493
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.	0.8775521579924924
I believe that in this context, and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust, it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol.	1.275417998455207
It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading.	0.8184576734747883
However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission' s staff is very low.	0.9380999517461635
To this end, the Brok report is a good instrument and it is really a bit distressing that, because this is a joint debate, it is politically overshadowed by the political position of the Council and the Commission and we cannot therefore say more about this good report.	1.2373144745373608
Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation.	1.1033242368537595
(Applause from the PSE Group)	0.2874658629903202

Madam President, there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the European Union.	1.0397428704087917
The resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day is on demining, and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines: stocks in the Ukraine, stocks in Moldova and stocks elsewhere.	0.792595675738357
Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present.	1.0638100513699085
Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries.	0.9361165783320557
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	0.24433840450461042
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption?	0.6019438221912375
I believe that Mrs Theato' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here.	1.0136027844898017
It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments.	0.6832638986865063
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding.	0.7872940850731586
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place.	0.8645855474064648
It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective way, given that China has agreed with the European Union' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars.	1.0422338824106943
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006, i.e. EUR 195 billion, will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe.	0.7251052230962908
We are extremely disappointed.	0.6214962727379643
In my opinion, we should not jeopardise that common position, because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons.	1.2156461717966944
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community' s interests, its image and its relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life.	1.0339216024001454
We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come.	0.8951305646930736
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.	0.5655596599278473
This is patently not the case, since such a quota would not be realistic.	0.8142934081524498
Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work.	0.8975105531842653
It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place.	1.0026708940378528
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.	0.9778020820211332
Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe.	0.7131024993956325
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.	1.0277271684957678
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty.	0.8720849439190754
Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions.	1.0488827191910566
Thirdly, government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector, as defined in ESA 95.	0.920776782268504
We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate.	0.9045222043615705
In addition, the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor.	0.8786167340614832
She said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador, a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, to tell her that she was wrong and the European Parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in China.	1.0330203634812605
His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact.	0.982879648910721
The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy.	0.8969386221336654
In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training.	0.650498146495895
All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process.	0.9692965342584985
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments.	1.0676284094718071
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence.	1.1555735676817105
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.	1.2453410874049369
But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise.	0.5979304525999272
As regards taxation, state aid, the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products, practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.	0.7122638064539419
I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all.	0.8375357292564144
Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.	0.9630968269911179
I believe we can learn something from this.	0.9061787432550847
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.	1.0983080927936468
The aim of this convention, which came into force on 24 October 1996, is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation.	0.8191431719597589
I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland, as testified by the present public system.	0.8537203051938935
It is impossible to talk about East Timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of Timorese refugees living on Indonesian soil in inhumane conditions, under the control of Indonesian soldiers and militias, and being used as bargaining chips.	0.664247183123831
This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted.	0.6483320846096416
We really hope and believe so.	0.4907965636236762
It is preferable for Member States to take measures to stimulate employment themselves.	0.7769278881406211
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.	0.658805280745864
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share and I shall not, therefore, repeat any of his ideas.	0.9086074948451676
Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.	0.95353283277591

Well, the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face.	0.6946467925656397
There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technical Development and Demonstration.	0.8587404489930588
This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last.	0.7906969239947018
However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents.	0.976792632297872
I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem, i.e. Communism.	0.7028220631947384
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.	0.6571549600880128
Mr President, Mrs Theato' s report on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor.	0.8953489540449131
In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff.	0.9325512020325277
I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system.	0.5953757639699728
Mr President, there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security, freedom and justice.	0.9236110492095859
I just wanted to correct this.	0.30176279703901776
Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud, nepotism and corruption in the European Commission.	1.0740416103136226
Austria is a free, independent and sovereign country.	0.6951015521551631
In this regard, I am simply pleased - delighted, in fact - here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa' s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU' s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa.	1.0944376546885362
This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation.	0.776327993166788
We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted.	1.1755482973965745
So we shall be freeing up new resources, but - I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters.	1.1724789932696598
The debate is closed.	0.1372665058484963
A European patent is in the offing, and that is a good thing.	1.164167125610578
I, for my part, have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them.	0.9835624243190487
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.	1.0799371234898796
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?	0.774023367374585
It is impacting on the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situations in Namibia and Zambia. It is now also affecting the situation in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the Congo to prop up Laurent Kabila who is beyond salvation.	0.6501205493709841
By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account.	0.9167522142294247
I am sure that it will serve, amongst other things, to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.	0.9171823761689836
Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light.	1.0832586245792284
We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant.	0.9599282446244942
Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lomé Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open.	1.0338812533071113
The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition.	0.9852056526991383
The debate is closed.	0.2168682454277559
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.	0.8637495452640563
Mr President, Commissioner, besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment, they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the European Union' s existence.	0.9791222938246759
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles.	0.9910768756247044
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama.	0.5294995218816586

Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interwoven.	0.6352497036727484

The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is, after all the difficult phases it has been through, at least satisfactory.	0.9193938698477072
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.6312346055827952
. (SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people' s health and the environment.	0.9099878036147562
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.	0.931520243733544
In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers' responsibility will become a shared responsibility.	1.1322082755460001
Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing.	1.1007470579065965
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention, for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report, contributing excellent and constructive ideas; and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur.	0.8077055835047414
Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made, we, the European Parliament, would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas, as well as its lack of common vision and, in particular, the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament.	1.0850661437349733
In this connection, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds.	0.6940415386799915

I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now.	1.23631054204953
The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire.	0.49455522057550405
If I may make a suggestion, Commissioner Barnier, would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject, in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament?	1.1481347027708242
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base.	1.2076071986396768
We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda, which also includes what is known as 'quality of life' priorities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consumers and as people, in relation to those questions which we always talk about, but never give sufficient priority to, that is, the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances, consumer rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development.	1.1716384564035711
Nevertheless, new objectives have been included, specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000, for which all rural regions will be eligible.	1.139246045915493
In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world.	1.1609317177258873

However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.	1.1579290354899228

As an integral part of a value-added structure, the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication: to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk; to be highly visible; to tell the good news story about food; to be proactive.	0.9350889688063235

Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission' s possession.

I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.	0.9809442025315007
The other main reason, however, is that, even though we are concerned here with a Convention (and therefore with international cooperation), there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal. And the trend is towards creating, in the longer term, a common European area of jurisdiction, common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice.	1.161101963244289
It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty.	1.223167383206306
A second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers' clutches is the cost of transport.	0.6073910189500278

As a sign of our political commitment, we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects.	0.8075486537324369
However, if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs, this would clearly not be enough.	1.0704113490233134
The vote will be taken later this evening.	0.967405274610407
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.	1.0195587482141515
But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men, particularly in politics.	1.1074843953960545
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law.	0.7521984974756711
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve.	0.8860594615987177
I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks.	0.9335691713415339
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.	1.047767676197235
The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure.	0.7328009474789128

A Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market. It also has important implications for public health.	1.1115722922647049
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti!	0.3802312399760692
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent.	1.1050391147578864
In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.	0.8247208358211011
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised, that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it.	1.2194130015562206
I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation, especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue.	0.7624550791896028
A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)];	0.5660201609937756
Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.0438169402297628
Lastly, but maybe most importantly, we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas, bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems.	1.0268790744805527
Up until now, the Commission' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.	0.8320728585285537
With reference to the IGC, as you know, under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC.	0.9201905484570229
No, Mr President, I am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself.	1.0743868673434729
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union.	0.9244977697863408
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress.	0.7024238128917742
Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.	1.133024250699978
The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories, at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine, whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat.	0.8945262654115812

The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000) by Mrs van der Laan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament, II - Council, III - Commission, IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors) [SEC(1998) 520 - C4-0350/1998, SEC(1998) 522 - C4-0351/1998, SEC(1998) 519 - C4-0352/1999]	0.7859637058760303
I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries.	0.8233811684709987
It is a step in the right direction, even if one wonders why in heaven, with what right and with what respect for our citizens, we are further bolstering the monopoly of the English language in all documents distributed throughout Europe.	0.8148574145566908
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans.	0.8804111883402089
It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made, particularly at the Beijing Conference.	1.151237567411445
Marketing, reservation and transport are expected to be the areas of profoundest change and improvement.	0.7011770713907726

You must embark on a dialogue with the international community.	0.60167413681382
Unfortunately, this is not true of them all, but this is why I am calling on the Commission to follow up on the Viceconte report.	1.4159547747865675
Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exactly what we need.	1.025935813918337
I want to emphasise four points.	0.7795768679592135
LEADER+ differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible. It is also more ambitious, and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet.	0.9413983288424534
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.	0.9868225055640594
Mr Prodi talks solely of 'mechanisms' and 'structures' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people.	0.5398170371843799
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject.	0.8962437885127081
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us.	1.0128671764636037
In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration.	0.9380137850103425
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States themselves which devise their own social security systems.	0.8961307046981454
There is, however, one thing we should not overlook.	1.0190979053667446
The word that is used about them in Chinese society is 'snake-heads' . It seems to me a fitting description of them.	0.7171140787783541
Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases.	0.8329197009141027
rapporteur.	-0.0
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population.	0.6167748232577367
I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present.	0.5102084103508777
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital.	0.8542090752145808
Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying "the confederate solution would be best" .	0.6321280920765189
In its communication "Women and Science" , the European Commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in Europe.	0.9405995192683767
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.	0.9225232445759879
With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000.	0.9981483134446726
I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP.	0.6664643584575776
We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all.	0.9208023611940239
As is so often the case, it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem, which will only serve to create more jobs for officials, and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money.	0.8806865132574734
I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here.	0.7773189512231512
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council' s scope for action.	0.9567965793724484
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically, resulting in a loss of jobs.	0.9010994705739085
The applicant countries' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens, who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe works, as it is not resolving the most serious problems.	1.007453182773403
The possibility, if necessary, of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement, as there really is justification for it.	0.8935584596736209
On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	0.6132020531146817
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement.	0.5477566627976822
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product' s life-cycle. Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste.	0.8067959154145322
It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof.	1.034467513356103
If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them.	1.0468102484592379
Those rights are, by definition, universal.	0.7454390432075425
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters.	0.8224335718508643
We have to be aware of this.	1.2455672590993454
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides.	0.7154863238066527
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction.	0.928650957694145
In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme.	0.6374815194637871
Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population.	0.574805174728322
Unfortunately I do not have time to go into depth on this issue. If Mr MacCormick would be satisfied with my partial agreement with his reasoning, I will give him a full answer in writing by restating the legal bases of both Article 11 in general and Article 11(1) in particular.	1.0805405007980635
That is why again, in my report, I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem: these areas do not have single, "mono" problems.	1.1738410287847978
As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.	0.8803458384003028
I would like to warn against a blurring of standards in the assessment of human rights situations in Africa, where violations are viewed as a necessary evil.	0.7695388274062824
Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.	1.2075742987655864
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice, with special emphasis on mainstreaming.	0.6638601220838136
In promoting cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory.	0.996493555168332
Here again, Commissioner, the ball is in your court.	0.7731044889303064
So far, social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources.	0.8086539328670601
Our answer to this crucial question is no.	0.5353551544863334
The company went under despite this.	0.258004921171945
As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament.	1.3193539303146418
Parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got, at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the basement that we can use to print euro notes!	0.961203388356732
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.	0.8344371426202011
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues.	0.9291747346457585
This question does not challenge the efforts made by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere, for example in China.	0.7614903887490034
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.36803341712664467
They have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area; the new and positive conditions which have been created, in very many cases on Greece' s initiative.	0.9880960149506164
Allow me also to add that, if the budget is increased, greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with.	1.0488768929669845
Madam President, I would simply like to point out that during the procedure, we were not allowed either to table or, consequently, adopt amendments in the Committee.	0.9591169384877367
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women, or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?	0.7481792701964575
This new imperial policy advocates reorganising European and national institutions, strengthening the power of the state, increasing competition, establishing a European army and redistributing financial resources.	0.6926260086295989
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.	0.6796232919101616
Let us take a very simple parameter: turnout at the next European elections.	0.6352709235485141
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change, the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing, constantly affect our common and vital but, in some ways, unowned resources.	0.9244205438932251
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected.	0.9565974623742024
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.	0.7022022651112865
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control.	1.2922860434553431
Mr President, there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to Cyprus and Malta is important.	0.8581806410189469
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome.	0.7772371363182116
In my opinion, what we are discussing here today is partly the EU' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance.	0.9469577589823833
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report.	0.6128869458492145
Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop, it will also have social and economic benefits and, at the same time, public health standards will improve.	0.8627787889428132
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.	0.8913479793693019
It is therefore easy to understand the public' s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them.	0.9912642719781659
Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups.	0.8230129318689371
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise.	0.9762814852872532
We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry.	0.6114341688754116
Then if it is really necessary for me to do this, I will make comments or recommendations to the Greek Government.	1.0979221175597667
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones.	0.8106466589762833
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.	0.9121999410589401
Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence, and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100%?	0.8581117343875531
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.	0.7781977911800263
The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade, despite their vulnerable economies.	0.8674709754568393
That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom.	0.6601902953427109
It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised.	0.9156321920117497
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that.	0.8289025496587286
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds.	0.9076369615318423
The time for resolutions has passed.	0.6652413053114522
Mr Haider has demonstrated, over the past years by both words and deeds, that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse.	0.8180544996183693
Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry, particularly the more vulnerable groups, such as young people, women and the unskilled.	0.9310233736498396
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	0.9281484639842642
Today, Parliament is examining, for the last time, this text on 'end-of-life' vehicles and what is to be done with them: their destruction, a commendable intention with regard to our environment.	1.0301755304029707
In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.	0.8252944851243956
It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it.	0.8017091595069568
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone.	0.7556080469603147
Mr President, everyone who has travelled here by car, train or aeroplane, has been able to see the extent of the damage, particularly in France, caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month.	0.9642703714679055
Together with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses.	1.1151638143300815
Parliament cannot, in any case, at present do anything about the matter.	1.0183221911954636
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high?	0.7400343064872056
In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.	1.1258057373702828
I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that.	0.853957070818941
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed, consisting of the following elements: an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, simplification of administrative procedures, improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment.	0.8734920003688026
Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.	1.0756055137483347
I think we all acknowledge the economic, social and environmental importance of tourism in today' s developed Europe and its great potential for growth and employment.	0.7531926099171753
The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness.	0.3865655765625635
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable.	0.49985202379668237
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness.	0.6537586453694302
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December.	0.6173056886704806
Paragraph D points out that "the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria" , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils.	0.9890864662297999
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment.	0.9943022414404872
These problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there. This therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in El Ejido and throughout Europe.	0.7628345856393394
Without them we would not be able to function.	0.8856584979889419
Such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries, thereby complicating enlargement.	0.7573656055542647
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today.	0.6386837002312481
Mr President, I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.	0.7362812594687584
I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait.	1.061313882381367

If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other, both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and, indeed, among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe.	0.9833639161152156

Of course, the final trade-offs will be made, as in any institutional negotiations, and I think this is no bad thing, at Council level, especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government, who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.	1.1327344204850351

Personally, I prefer the willingness that is clearly flagged up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities, non-governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can progressively achieve ownership cooperation.	1.0243522763397208
In particular, we intend that the European Union should maintain a constant profile on this issue, and of course all the more so since Cyprus is a candidate for membership of the European Union with negotiations at a fairly advanced stage. This naturally raises certain expectations and means that the role of the European Union is of some relevance in this context.	1.0245296230859495
My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system, adopting common procedural rules and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons.	0.8266486927487227

Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was.	0.9592514049701539
After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting.	0.7419523262033998
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity.	0.9281694152023545
This question has now entered a different dimension, a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments, no more than 3% of which have anything to do with the real economy.	0.8753034444392486
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force the Commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of Article 13 including, in particular, a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin.	1.0610297685919792

In any event, for those Members who not aware of the President' s position, I will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today' s Minutes:	0.9801040201559119
Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion.	1.0095751955702446
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive.	1.0101761099294273
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.	1.0253940446526173
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers!	1.2109124494138919
I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now.	1.0180238241396091
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	0.9143448715149117
This is the essence of how I understand the situation: we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly, that, basically, the Members of Parliament should drop their claims, particularly claims on the budget, for if we do not soon, in line with the codecision procedure, get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for LIFE, then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay, and in the meantime the NGOs and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations.	1.0135120184845063
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go.	0.7203934490016872
As the Commissioner said, and I agree with him, it is a matter of political decision.	1.4490165404941824
At the moment, with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them, the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important.	0.6342671463026782
If the Member States decide, in agreement with ourselves, that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control, then they must also make the necessary personnel available.	1.0943287554913657

We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner.	1.1782010599193256
In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment.	0.9334471535532098
That is a clear complaint that we get.	1.0805912497702728
(FR) A few days after the demonstrations in Seattle, the ministers of the European Union imposed an agreement compatible with the rules of the WTO on the ACP, i.e. their former colonies.	0.9396224620115327
I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging, especially as regards trade, and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area.	1.0920031472094531
This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible, in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties.	1.0836263921584566

We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent.	1.2364566304748859
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.	0.9551819732064557
This is what enables them to understand what is going on.	0.8018047273554398
I repeat, a "serious and persistent breach" is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State.	1.0792023403076914
My position on this is clear.	0.7410166191143538
It has never been done in south-east Asia, it has never been done in Europe, and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber, given Austria' s financial record.	1.1213517237509918
Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.	1.109176304557952
I do not know if Mr Monti is aware of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of last week, 10 February, which recognised the possibility of the German postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly.	0.9778283592549375

I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede.	1.0420446239030892

(PT) Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the Council presidency, and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen Member States are to approve in the Council. Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission, and it is important to maintain this.	0.9929970527147316
Drawing to a close, I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated, Mrs Schroedter.	0.8564232640546874
But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well?	0.994321406484838
I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives.	0.8832164034816353
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason.	0.9420587001725382
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.	0.8397043269062597
By staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of Jörg Haider' s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government, a situation without precedent since the second world war, the European Union has come into its political birthright and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community, a large market, a "Europe of shopkeepers" .	1.0065236246027485
Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty.	0.8241652379505272
It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned.	1.0345898268717058
Our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao led us to four conclusions: firstly, that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore, far from reducing the EUR 900 million for the last five year period to EUR 700 million for this five year period, the funding of this project should be increased. This should be done, for example - and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed this - by reinvesting, in URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose.	1.040123944406998
We hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking, which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the Commission as an executive.	1.04641128974498
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning.	0.8948726954780168

We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text, and for example, to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done, i.e., that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty.	1.1323682832244708
In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems, also deriving from American legislation, which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.	0.9891173119009247

In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.	1.2581393296429448

In this regard we strongly support the High Representative' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo.	0.8703958333358119
We all, throughout the European institutions - in Parliament, the Council and the Commission - should be doing our best to aid Cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which brings together these two communities which have been divided for too many years.	0.9264876150151072
Mr President, the draft resolution we are now discussing requires, precisely as before, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions.	1.111816865741585
In this respect the Commission communication before us today is opportune, as is the report by Mr Viceconte whom I congratulate.	1.3569701951186168
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which, for various reasons, a Member can formulate more openly.	0.8754758290097745
My question, which has not been answered, is why, when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union, the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether.	1.1845724681387462
Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about.	1.0798076844912157
My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services.	0.7414580703869943
We should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene, with renewed strength, to safeguard human rights.	1.1660582555796708
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.	0.8221361074228412
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful.	0.5292231015922686

Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries.	1.1975738406152714
On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue, and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas.	0.8663277912716502

It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made.	0.9886035223556991
How do you intend to make our people understand that, today like always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is, and will remain, essential in the context of population?	0.9132081723369488
I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes, to post-conflict reconstruction, and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.	1.0572607087985983
Finally, Parliament recommends, in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution, that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence.	1.164414903654754
This is unacceptable in my view.	0.8600012394022638
By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool, in the hands of technocrats, for imposing new sets of conditions, the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty.	1.0299961684437942
The competition policy has, as far as these resources permitted, contributed to this event.	0.9574513890249932

It is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital-based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based, and, thus, opportunities for growth and investment will also improve.	0.8158149469975026
Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials.	0.8709898604628958

I would like to quote verbatim from the report: "State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."	0.8569621897492667
Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation.	0.9263455762158594
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there?	0.9383410406950283
First of all, I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo, and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all.	0.9940222239372198
This gives rise to serious malfunctions, because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes, whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done.	0.7304228654236968

Madam President, I do not have a great deal to add on this subject.	1.1482527837959928
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility.	1.0226873700534982
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal.	1.0569965700662656

In the second, LIFE-Environment strand, which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies, the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed.	0.9034708258480288
Certain sectors of European industry, such as the shipbuilding industry, air transport and the steel industry, which have been hard hit by existing competition policy, have suffered tremendously.	0.8049831006445591
I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries.	1.0423688457618674
My reply to this is that, firstly, countries should honour their pledges, namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation, so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose, namely contributions to development cooperation, and not via an artificial and probably harmful route, namely the Tobin tax.	0.9863197137251007
I adamantly believe that the main risk to the world economy in the foreseeable future is not inflation, but deflation generated as the speculative bubbles, created by what Alan Greenspan calls irrationally exuberant markets, burst.	0.8065538961398102
(Applause) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays.	0.8967726247247005
I believe that we should be pleased about this.	1.0438028444249985
Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades.	0.7286646289210381
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.	1.074382195363047
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis.	0.9825339595557757

Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?	0.8881847314669352
This basic principle of liberalisation, increased competition and greater investment opportunities, together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve, has determined and inspired my Group' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen.	0.775623779661004
He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government.	0.8950684039049127
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on.	0.5546387850062077
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, for your valuable contribution to this Question Time.	1.1137826289473958
This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used.	1.0238387565713658
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.	0.7050550928336928
As regards rental rights, on interpretation of Article 9, we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists, interpreters or performers, only if this is laid down by national legislation. I think this conflicts with Article 13.	1.0788226310943934
There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several.	0.971340463755966
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.	0.682989352177277
You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society, not only economically but also in terms of public health.	0.8104194735268103
To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds.	0.9679319445071605
. As Mrs Wallström explained during yesterday's debate, the Commission is able to accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13.	0.9003762426746743
Fourthly, increasing audiences for culture, with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and, fifthly, protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe, and making them better known.	0.8786185711504255
This is also expressed in Recital 14.	0.8993946126254619
With closed production circuits this is possible; anything else would water down the directive.	0.45716752346044776
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	0.873524103095999
In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.	1.0675463275993131
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.	0.8886455833007674
. Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.	0.6677561849246944
I also believe that Parliament' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission' s proposal.	0.9357205136347158
I welcome you and your ambition.	0.5040120789665464
Amendment No 8 because the proposed, general reference to assets 'covered by this directive' , instead of the more precise reference to assets 'mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive' , hinders implementation.	0.6931672634524315
He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is, by any definition, a thorny issue, not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State.	1.0769364421696095
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.	0.7464333278918783
EQUAL should live up to its name, and this is my firm intention.	0.9500558764278805
Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules.	0.789351931876568
What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold.	0.8392620642515083
But we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union' s financial programmes and instruments.	0.9083074049225909
Surely we should be more selective.	1.028678393776854
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.	0.9134526402096805
A single key is to suffice in future.	0.31940515547004705
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied, and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this.	1.2102747706734034
In fact, water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market.	0.7909739284267046
There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology.	1.1420522513187898
It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned.	1.1454087703532219

But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions.	0.5998221361581226
The framework conditions have changed in that the Helsinki decisions made a whole range of things possible that were not possible hitherto, and, above all, in that the political strategies employed by the parties concerned have changed beyond recognition.	0.931926276040668
If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens.	1.013982443359144
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates.	0.5359411428927519
Mr President, first I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, for her work.	1.0515239280295774
This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider' s.	0.8986796751081805
They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force.	0.6198469504388264
We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well.	0.8054384024537721
Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as.	0.7619814405807188
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous.	1.2884797520791953
Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy.	0.9013081389269567
We know that you have an important role in this.	1.209065546218808

If liberalisation continues in this area too, then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service.	1.0766647516240484
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing.	1.0780969200700707
This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court.	0.7477798825397393
I condemn Jörg Haider' s racist and xenophobic policy.	0.5045801074661305

This was the opening statement of Commission President, Prodi, when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years.	1.1442430818112812
In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry.	0.8818697253650377

The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers.	0.8740908630688718
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most basic aims of the European Union' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area, and this, of course, presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved.	1.0235743739280247
The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved, too.	0.9297251269801255
More generally, those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy, devoted exclusively to the interests of big business, has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders, and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right.	0.8610806609874037
Mr President, what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as 'terrorists' and 'bandits' ?	0.8208259086677052
The flooding has been going for weeks, and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need.	0.9279564922994313
We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread.	1.1237677664424368
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.7064346352129416
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.	0.9083212777352581
We can therefore safely say, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people, who always opposed occupation by Indonesia.	0.937656814183439
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field, because they were the first ones to develop that area, gives one food for thought, I feel, and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies.	0.9401126847080222
At a more central level, there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors, international NGOs, indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted.	0.7421692634130213
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance.	0.9612585159853735
I would like everything to happen much more quickly.	0.8484246868230858
The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month.	0.8990248351393704
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.	0.9671374278846929
Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand.	0.7955033255431596
However, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years.	0.9090150619768763
LIFE is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the Community budget, and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been stagnating for years. Despite the enlargement which has already taken place, when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second, despite enlargement, the level of appropriations remained the same.	1.1119277395652327
We already have a directive.	0.5545784125513509
The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.	0.7757142616869035
Finally, will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid, as they should be, on the basis of all the work they do for us?	1.1848851304963128
The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances (lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chrome, PVC and halogenated flame retarders).	0.5585161181675806
Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front.	1.0311255327791136
Then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work.	0.7323119325310881
Having said this, some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe.	0.8206177688657772
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.	1.019937933625771
Well, we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment.	1.3654130261049167
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology, employment - will be a decisive summit.	0.8792543668062223
In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal.	0.8223238758393306
Europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water, promote its sustainable use, protect eco-systems, help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	0.8419320822874508
Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure.	0.9367508248875902
Will it be omitted?	0.6551747688294406

We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature, allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes.	0.7985127348876069
Subject: Alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action does the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by Sweden, and the associated import restrictions, and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied?	1.120653195908916
	-0.0
Well, I, and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it.	0.8893611158898665
I think that the answer is brief and clear.	0.9442302710506285
That is where we really get into difficulty.	0.7020197953500295
. Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council.	0.9028028750459214
We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing.	0.988755748969211
I will save a few seconds because I wanted to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs.	0.8361972415075205
We will make the Community institutions aware of what we are able to do, and what is possible in general, as regards coordination, not just at political level but also as regards what the Commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process.	1.2421746958487416
Two types of measure are required for this purpose. The first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration.	0.9959666219004241
Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence, a basic principle of international fundamental rights.	0.9380743932211146
The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point.	1.1109429584926922
We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament, without hampering the work of Europol.	0.8563993448635058
In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security, the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that, alongside vertical exemptions, horizontal exemptions will also be possible.	0.984146990823225
The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime.	0.637053853504388
In specific terms, we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiations, at which this will be a central issue.	1.1987562372501466
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives, including the one on auto-oil, which we voted on a few years ago.	0.9436002129737081
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays?	1.216335050241566
Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.	0.9842033814063839
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States.	0.799870075554185
I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.	0.9248526983290976
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.	0.7976103823596365
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today.	0.7535135583567542
It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.	0.9338536787031204

I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far.	0.7653555999833802
Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe,	1.0035327683849649
This is what we need for ships.	0.9546681549340698
Mr President, because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry, detailed information on their use is needed from the actors, and as we know there are a lot of them, so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law.	0.9588048038190782
An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries. These include technology, trade, cooperation in the field of research etc.	0.9466543999319808
Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full.	0.9228458148118766
In the stance that we took at Seattle, why such a silence on the EU' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT, including for the crucial textile sector?	0.6774297177466361
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations.	0.7465407080357827
At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution.	1.0669406233269028
Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?	1.0354238684105117
According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations.	1.0428080470930223
There is also another important aspect which I referred to at the beginning of my statement, and this relates to Turkey' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession.	1.0640943150960591
Sadly, only 7.2% of the projects requested receive funds.	0.9893817973671778
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.	1.0691543617802024
Currently, women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts, and we hope the number will increase steadily.	1.0189344989648923
The European Union' s position on this is crystal clear, and I do not think it is worthwhile second-guessing particular phrases in the Council' s conclusions or in any other statement.	1.0984639497367878
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme.	1.0004803990828415
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)	0.264040334993697
I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen.	1.0196656636055599
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement.	1.1408054027084633
Account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure.	1.003227101864623
It is a very extensive report.	1.0673633623913594
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team.	0.7684464709072967
Finally, if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit, I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, beyond that, of similar initiatives.	1.2605670799759172
And, finally, the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified. Regarding this, too, there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission.	0.8371136371679576
However, I would also like to add that any analysis, no matter how superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries.	1.0998087842997777
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda.	0.9153990665496554
The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without, at the same time, creating tensions.	0.68815516735043
Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food.	0.5756980919279722
That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms.	1.1672713832132446
We should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention, and then requested another: the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it, even if we hope that the amendments, which nevertheless improve the text, can be incorporated by the Council - we doubt that they will be, but hope all the same that they are.	1.22126661900525
Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.	1.1427702857183346
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days.	0.6529529138416166
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.	1.073543656410519
Mr President, in accordance with Article 69 (2), I call for referral back to committee.	0.9188605138973205
From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens.	1.020938424516506
In this sense, the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom, security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers.	1.0748846378052577
The laws against racism must be harmonised.	0.4484035853942907
We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures.	1.1556413193438038
Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming.	0.9265121241973009
We want the UN embargo, which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports, to stop.	0.7808857321655933
We should, at any rate, judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words.	0.7946129260042104
The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union' s foreign policy.	0.9817550779070596
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety.	0.876262521437114
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	0.9195116634692194
With regard to costs, I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about.	0.8066385367537264
As honourable Members will see from the document, which will be available to them today, the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission, with this Parliament and with the Council, which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January, have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements.	1.238733017210183
From this point of view, the other decision taken at Helsinki, namely to grant Turkey candidate status, gives the Fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with Ankara can and, in my view, should, include a determination to ensure that Turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two Cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united Cyprus and peace in the eastern Mediterranean.	0.9567878171639695
In this regard, too, the committee is prepared to go further than the Commission.	1.0918417849589956
Nevertheless, we must stress that many people are aware, as they were yesterday too, of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe, a risk that was, moreover, indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one' s attention, owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors.	0.9370785867680668
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react, identify issues before they become crises.	0.7065908532358839
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.	1.0088504111397234

I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States.	1.1707061491030877
It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union.	1.2489112272549772

Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia's sovereignty at Rambouillet.	0.732618714871177

I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.	0.8468007534520793
And so the debates taking place today focus on two major issues: firstly, comitology, an ongoing debate within this House, but Parliament wished to implement policies settled rather by management committees or advisory committees which give the Commission some flexibility and which do not give the Council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the Community philosophy which we are here to stand up for within the European Parliament.	0.9220279933417159
As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.	0.7583361521073534
However, all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles.	0.9275236982066212

If you look carefully, this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets.	0.8615536079215647
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same.	0.8372236502577888
Will it do the same to us?	0.5458502891516198
I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe.	0.708559319114146
However, the appointment was cancelled at the last minute.	0.9449497546051037
The greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations, the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market.	0.7935482900590446
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union.	1.0642927604648382
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .	0.8582380285724861
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria.	1.1216353577509777
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo.	1.0896830522034664
Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP.	0.7750323507653039
Those figures are incomparably higher for some countries.	0.37601717421654735
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described, I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload.	0.8639199097350483
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land.	0.6921898655584001
There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority.	0.9530308111948343
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers.	1.0050354535000274
My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions?	0.8512829691611516
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility.	0.9479784939423525
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation.	0.8510442169557304
Relevant information must be given to prospective unit-holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country.	0.4943206059668591
Therefore, apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel has made, offering us all kinds of guarantees, as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich, I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People' s Party, if it goes ahead with this mad project.	0.9249700360902922
Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid, but much further out in our galaxy, the Milky Way, there are about 300 billion stars, many with planets.	0.9567125344742701
How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the Golan?	0.7480929425273253
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.	0.999586037624226
Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator.	0.48512241135024375
We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science.	0.6206602613885387
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks.	1.169408712480657
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?	0.7187950835106572
Furthermore, the recent Community budget cuts in this area, for the present financial year, are part of this trend, as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message.	1.0863390251828493
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.	0.9627369112830169
I ask this because of the issue of coherence, the subject of this morning' s discussion.	0.9404375051831498
Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone.	0.9695718916022897
My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further.	0.7825213770587278
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner, without any backhandedness.	1.0052404753341573
The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled.	0.754875052882948
That concludes the vote.	0.5733173817338488
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority.	0.7590446506807659
So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied.	0.9541392020082573
We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever.	0.9190832323271235
This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.	1.1460136721426024
We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence.	1.2204431813411822
We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention.	0.8410113478191341
Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy.	0.8049733849832807
We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations.	1.0761124017797106
Are there any comments?	0.268475952456507
This was, after all, one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission.	0.7581467098141165
Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos, in situations where there are inadequate facilities, where schooling is very poor, where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife.	0.9079544615273882
Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission.	0.9746607452408302
I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece.	1.0156400505730736
(FR) Madam President, when a Swede, a Spaniard, a Luxembourgeois and a German have to negotiate in English, linguistic ambiguities will arise.	0.9081616716374616
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and, if necessary, tying this in with financial aid, a higher return can be achieved.	0.7461656530688094
Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people, the regions and the Member States. The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively.	1.0095975431596178
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation.	0.7968541193246496
I am, however, optimistic.	0.3529993390332965
What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?"	0.6075871294745743
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	0.6491137777728151
My second question concerns the fact that, in many contexts, we talk about the ACP countries having to learn the principles of democracy.	1.1973343093963147
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said.	0.9879751226650968
That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level.	0.807026502204009
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other, that of finding the easiest possible solution.	1.305767131752015
It would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because I can see a particular problem with coordination, specifically between the Commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments, but also members of national parliaments - and our committee' s programme. Following the working meeting of 1 February, which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission, the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings.	1.105765875737531
Mr President, through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union.	0.9789706778904539
. (DA) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999.	0.9913869182812701
I would first of all like to focus on quality.	0.5810278295759651
Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy.	0.9597214204581868
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed.	1.0276251995113992
We wish to see its competences extended, especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options, certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens.	1.0792976501730218
The Union' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to more fruitful cooperation.	0.9491332969776934
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs.	0.8632328421923331
Both parties were once part of the government.	0.7036866525181011
Each Member State ought to have full responsibility for, and the right autonomously to decide upon, its social security systems.	1.085240194525924
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission' s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative.	1.1167545428989105
The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here.	0.8197405010456136
As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example.	0.8546427638173238
The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights.	0.6911742206481842
Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency.	0.9208579322254828
No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals.	1.0074164930358234
As the UK business grew, we invested in more people, as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery.	0.8701524795156846
You have not integrated it anywhere.	0.7350005897145894
This failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing, we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side.	0.6603359104211018
This limited training element has, however, been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times.	0.792243751338225
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage.	0.9436512998024316
But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions.	1.0278977646298446
I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein' s firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council.	1.246134128012735
That was how it was.	0.3186302140555526
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter.	0.935222900700335
Mr Havel reminded us that the Union is not just about markets, about GDP growth, it is a Union of values that is reflected in the Treaties and is reflected in our obligations in the whole area of external assistance, reflected quite specifically in what we are charged to do.	0.9942003056980742
Mr President, we certainly must concede that, on balance, this text is full of good intentions, but we did not vote in favour of it in committee, nor shall we do so in plenary. We had two reasons for this, both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly.	1.2199605489869327
The Commission, as I have promised, will complete its proposals on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few weeks.	1.1860219231199665
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider' s offensive statements, the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes on successive days.	0.7667915014184348
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.41843580079670606
In no case, however, are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature.	0.822433672535138
Secondly, it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations, which were advocated by the European Parliament at first reading. Specifically, these are: to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects, and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination.	1.1883738113282916
It is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends.	0.8667355919872055
It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system.	0.6951621793927101
A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling.	1.1275016404172091
Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, so many names we remember with horror.	0.6692797265401984
In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.	0.7547836001748633
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these?	0.7947833099799151
In three weeks' time, I shall be in Paris, and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another.	1.1165611917688771
In particular, we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island.	0.9239741448760241
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.	0.7931312307171172
Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	1.0527743197527204
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.	0.8598029081597959
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication.	0.8326038736174375
Soon, in May, the European Commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the Union' s external relations.	1.1498382788046935
It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars.	0.8607034949137229
Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon.	1.2235602586659282
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.	0.9641413536282167
Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres.	0.9441982204883341
Yet this is not the situation.	0.9700118703657494
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market.	0.8784176191680252
Mr Corbett referred to that, but the new model is certainly much more complex, different because the situation is now different, and, in our opinion, much more coherent.	1.0721435893771836
These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote.	1.1196639601865654
On the other hand, the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants, and the people that will not benefit from the new services.	1.0645093601435787
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia.	1.3038570952955215
The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)].	0.6805870043053696
Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same. Of course, in reality, they are the same thing.	0.8650657625691238
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending' in this House, and I thank you for it.	0.8794871091913935
May I say something about costs.	0.7251685386632176
These proposals must include a number of elements, an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies, a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan.	0.7794980104282107
But I must record that other groups, led by the PSE Group, guided by my countryman, Stephen Hughes, voted this out.	0.7482384062640044
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine, themselves, what its future should be.	0.8375369105494215
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them.	1.0359966519163304
Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission.	0.8618038034058869
Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.	0.9323470911706142
I will say one thing. For many years I was a traitor to my country; at least that was General Franco' s view.	0.8701740259867656
I think what we need is, at European level, to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible.	1.0496019668725336
This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency.	0.8516991215736149
A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature.	0.8928240558904248
Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid.	0.9725619002812894
In my view, it is the task of the European Union to employ all instruments, including this one, so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means.	0.9407761990393658
Mr President, the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news, but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people.	0.7913901022889547
Mr President, it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague, Mr Evans, of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status.	0.8345486806527821
Intergovernmental Conference	-0.0
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe.	0.7228517171112842
I await with interest developments in Cuba.	0.42496678191694914
When social security has repeatedly, and in the words of many influential people, been characterised as a 'cost' and an 'obstacle' to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people - always, of course, on the pretext that this will create jobs - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability, with its dismal monetary-economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests, were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care.	0.7952517955308381
We decentralise administrative and, in some cases, financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective.	0.7041182858197482
The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.	0.6013528408567641
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.	0.8629266809631467
The first comment, which has been made by many others too, is whether women should be mentioned separately.	1.154137341977435
Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare, including within the spheres of education, health care and social services.	0.6718634115375043
But, otherwise, we must all of us, as taxpayers or citizens, foot the bill. What is more, the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action.	0.9073542149979024
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development.	0.7663858070537108
Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.	0.8507138331026907
You perhaps know that, in Finland, the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader, but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion.	1.0373340763211567
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.	0.8280151436004869
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law.	0.9609444269921008
Therefore, it is my firm belief that, since Helsinki, there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict.	1.0701674490737658
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative.	0.6781781880227485
Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome.	0.7071866200586031
I would therefore like, equally firmly, to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences, which are still no doubt profound, between the parties.	1.0952411790120862
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria.	0.8893745798947746
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice.	1.0484865489950357
And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day.	0.8804822343840522
Mr Cashman said, which is right in a sense, that words are no substitute for real action.	0.8110350326487293
This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general.	0.9307667726667564
There may be a number of views on that.	0.7069508271350303
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action.	0.5033739035116628
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future.	0.618779976223961
But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved.	0.8481225276325213
This is why this report is so important.	1.166707425764118
The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)).	0.5234541891894181
But for pity' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.	0.930722259041407
The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis.	0.9572185641206431
However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations.	0.9176560344333284
I must respond also to the fact, of course, that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity, the complacency and the fragility of the Commission' s opinion.	1.0497141447947425
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan, in the case of steel, as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid.	0.7859668076176513
They see us killing each other.	0.600253645661466
Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament.	1.1738007109805026
We might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation.	0.8810095837608931

In addition, amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage.	0.777828718833582
I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there.	1.175598802622782

Apart from this, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way, on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain.	0.7942491881592958

All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy, human rights, governance and an independent judiciary are, I am sure, welcome.	0.9234216629511475
However, the people are fighting back, as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit. The leaders of the world, headed unfortunately by the European Commission, rushed forward submissively, hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world, Mr Clinton, would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table.	0.8864242890309206
And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region.	1.102306175399273

We know that the European Union has its own dynamics, which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which has reinforced its political dimension. This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development.	1.1283252186596286

There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at, especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries.	1.0632375526880216

Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what, if any, consideration has been given to it?	0.8277178577152867
Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007.	1.018636847112042
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical.	0.875971976377027
That is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas, as a transitional measure, contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women, particularly in political life.	0.8316775775086404
The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected.	0.926005872203669
The initiative adopts a completely new approach, which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships.	0.7135575533155808
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities" and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity.	1.1492031110838976
It was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects, which are very important for a country like Portugal, which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio-economic development.	0.8668281574774749

You have set a very good example of time-keeping today.	0.7799696546937219
This is an issue which, as you will understand, will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue, because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place.	1.2022344237389055
This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions.	1.2004743798381576

Is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field?	0.9774506133187112
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing.	0.731901393050354
That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!	1.038969782001338
Consequently, approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance, because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights.	1.086832653981571
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union' s activities and ask why, then, you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation.	0.9842111669773453
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted, and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards.	0.7211360417089994
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.	0.7379343611390708
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded?	0.7241802993602395
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement, and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities.	0.9697976123751761
Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this.	0.8949642855521276
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business: a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy.	0.7453841445649831
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.	0.9752884527474829
The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.	0.8234623580300966
This goes against the Commission' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements.	0.7212987917717488
It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future.	0.8437705022126435
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.	0.7308665498411135
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.	0.8324533980073775
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.	1.221499077998486
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.	1.1722370030178482

Mr Sjöstedt, the answer that I gave was the only answer possible.	0.8086600980397863
Madam President, according to various Members of your Parliament, more funding should still be made available for major projects.	0.7909232008291185
To conclude, I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights.	0.6453212921183673
We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place.	0.8819103547737905
Moreover, the concept of 'author' is not defined in the Treaties.	0.7851663073461169

First, while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference, several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move, not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself.	0.8707120077135172
When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals.	1.0793763088707573
Today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine, although we do not know how much tax is put on it, but I suppose it is a lot.	1.0368293293208142
The new programme will, I am sure, in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency, efficiency and balance, prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures.	1.122222995393511
The Security Council feels that the solution to the Cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two-zone, twin-community federation, in other words a single state, as Mr Verheugen mentioned, consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities.	0.9608672361603937
I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.	0.9117031574947869
Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid.	0.9051742813732595
Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.	0.8787439317414343
However, my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage, is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so, Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties, ...	0.8723752554550421
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court.	1.1914844599690038
So, Madam President, maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance.	0.7865548233860816
Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection.	0.3714996032957893
One of the matters to be settled is whether Members are to receive equal pay, and where they are to pay tax.	1.125218175855146
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions, which are weaker than the nation states, will easily submit to Brussels.	1.1555747188050378
Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.	1.037059517295093
The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results.	1.009285951281466
It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again, which can quite easily be done with the aid money.	1.1408529220413968
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions.	0.9377435534364611

. Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services.	0.9504054186133157
Commissioner, thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer, which has been rigorous and well-argued.	0.8661602158983499
A drop in the ocean, I might say, in comparison with Europe' s structural policies.	1.06417938676923
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America.	1.0322757471261916
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica?	0.6998439510908195

Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):	0.2171650424295278
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.	0.8851402171841852
We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development.	0.9463128514344972

Madam President, unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language.	1.0095503096290184

Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.6535079693577721

There is, of course, no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS.	0.8246749563550146
Mr President, the oil tanker Erika, the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil, foundered off the Breton coastline, with disastrous consequences.	0.7652795493100183

My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.	0.8643533817585161

That is very much the right approach.	0.9597817098453675
I am speaking today wearing a number of hats: firstly, as the surrogate father of this report; secondly, as the draftsperson of the opinion; and most importantly, as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship, employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights.	1.020553511267063
Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences.	0.5522177378334922

The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy.	0.6834600978190609
Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz.	0.5659856728374084

There will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope, as Mr Patten said just now, that this postponement of the negotiations due to Syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East.	0.9139375004970413

Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation.	0.952377210530925

In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes.	0.9251081950953995
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas.	0.8279264057703439

Just a few main points.	0.6637888331112466
It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.	1.2056278036568668

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted.	1.1382188943803362
You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year' s work programme.	0.6749896344652973

Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament.	0.8200320633173669

That would be a similar situation.	0.9077403886001043
Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten' s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole.	0.7830810565889882
I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy.	1.0122529843348342
Granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well: there will be enough to drink for a while, but tomorrow the well will be dry again.	0.6656054261439315
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, let me say how disappointed I am, because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago.	0.7586121544965067
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue.	0.795673953838889
Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million, whereas the Commission proposed 81.1 million, a figure which the European Parliament supported.	0.9646232656360368
What are the values of the French Socialist Party, which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the Urba, Sages and Graco scandals?	0.8484768973397538
I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture.	1.0574801050232516
That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.	1.136568720433407
Cuba' s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle.	0.6615290400726734
We already have an infrastructure.	0.49467247205612996
Mr President, I voted for the Decourrière report on the Community initiative INTERREG, mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers. I voted for it, not just because I was born in a coastal town, Genoa, but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too.	0.8331580219712907
What difference does it make to be Basque? Surely it is all the same thing.	0.8898854609890672
I propose, therefore, that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date.	0.9560205558192929
Besides, Commissioner, is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo?	0.7572907824325471
What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue?	0.6411137781504713
The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor, on the initiative of the PPE Group, is a timely one.	0.8820031651545259
I would quote the PHARE programme as an example.	0.70692302936935
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted.	0.9989867516984307
For example, the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion, which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990.	0.8010892108627408
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things.	1.1068970666755256
This must be regulated during the IGC.	0.781296804918316
The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are, they say, incompatible with international trade law.	0.9313043512900078
We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.	0.7828067967693506
The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post' s numerous recent acquisitions.	0.6852875719401936
He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo.	0.8104603412621871
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.	0.7029755102695195
Madam President, I would like to comment on the Florenz report.	0.7730511933255265
In the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force, having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation.	0.832010712964098
However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout.	0.974001098118615
We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums.	0.3405986681767727
The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test.	0.6209355068392922
I have listened to the somewhat equivocal talk and silences on the part of the Council which, in my view, need clarifying.	0.7737954405550002
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade.	1.0825296965355817
We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament' s credibility.	0.6985407001288071
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation.	0.9366500108068397
Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members, rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent?	0.8244840193135321
There are problems regarding the term "author" .	0.5235207075903336
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament.	0.8768804860440552
However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment.	1.0888844279444188
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	0.8124767096801863
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries.	0.9940875956634116
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.	0.7640844530423816
This is, of course, a highly sensitive issue.	0.6741088760664979
Mr President, I believe Mr Alavanos is getting NATO and Mr Milosevic mixed up.	0.8352704329136429
That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation, as Mr Böge has just done.	0.9523368874406875
After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making.	0.95774729370026
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.	0.5378938728774495
The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda.	0.833117018622554
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept, and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety.	0.8180622593820758
This is not desirable, either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment.	0.869724149856604
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.	0.5689741703986557
This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment.	0.8972831311635118
It is very far from being that simple, rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts, during talks with both communities, to encourage them to reach an understanding.	1.1355655070717185
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion.	1.159028421057367
That is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive.	0.9200103593286149
(FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy.	0.8931404172919724
If we fail to complete it, citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement.	0.5449126414407968
We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship.	0.39463487681727016
Mr President, Mr van Hulten, your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising, arduous and complex, and I believe this is important in a first report.	1.0807434968645033
You yourself, Mr President, spoke of a model of which, unfortunately, there is little mention in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, both internally and towards the outside world, which differs from other models, including the US model.	1.1233662616212128
It is the humane face of Europe...	0.6639168212462864
In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance.	0.7733027865700018
In fact, the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997.	0.8892749850395996

It has to be redistributed time and again.	0.6184933572973667
In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents.	0.7145775112662938
As I said, their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character.	0.7306707472373853
A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states.	0.7898707122854456
Finally, the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity; nor Amendment No 19, which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage.	1.1539587197388144
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.	0.7356911045354734
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment; that is what was mentioned in your programme.	0.98618359104023
And because of the programme' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER.	0.8097651655796285
I would ask you to confirm that, if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects, then this official has got the wrong end of the stick, and that, if he has not said this, then there is no story.	1.1601223427577478
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out.	1.163152951576467
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC.	1.3056907454084148
It is with these phrases that Albert Camus, at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the close of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, "the brown plague" as it was termed at the time, could not enjoy a definitive victory.	0.7991402706439187
The Commission nonetheless considers that, if this is stated separately, then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas.	0.9795101184722685
Mr Purvis, as this discussion of salaries in the European Parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country, I have a precise idea of what the salaries of the Members of the European Parliament are worth.	1.0623012785536057
This is not a situation related to the economic climate, however; rather it is a structural problem, created by our remoteness, our insularity, in short, our own specific personality.	1.2394673127814924
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good.	0.677106096290756
I am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of Minister Gama' s insights, as he arrived hot-foot from the region.	0.932044690737527
Mr President, before I came here for today' s sitting, I was watching Finnish television.	1.068051229162697
Parliament has no equivalent power.	0.4037192341558001
In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981.	0.7802662585677047
By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.	1.0212437805264858
That is what Culture 2000 is about.	0.6916137893340651
I want us to be in a position in which we can say: 'It is not like that any more. We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can' .	1.0949172995943404
I say they have a right to solidarity.	0.6243500945430263
They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used.	1.0325319214137207
On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.	0.9901337281223768
Thirdly, the need to develop the employment side of growth, even though I am aware, as Mr van Dam just said, that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States, and that, when we speak of the responsibility of Member States, and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.	1.1936024962093754
Yugoslavia' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union.	1.0199921753038945
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.	0.7304255661068834
Finally, this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and condemnations prompted by such behaviour.	0.7262763185667916
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance.	1.0818910007847526
In this way, we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges.	0.8922797749388169
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	0.3152383256594625
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators, stockbrokers and option traders.	0.6551195767861298
Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area.	1.1972930296047337
It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital.	0.4883923089299317
Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health.	0.9900271042467266
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in, by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration.	1.044627389493167
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully.	0.9069552845655425
I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration - the Canary Islands.	0.7593137170579651
In my opinion, the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future.	0.7405358083087549
We have here an agreement which, in spite of its defects, constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright.	0.9485001958906212
Its argument was one of priority.	0.3470019462385727
Thank you, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect.	0.919813570460008
Allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Böge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees, with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa, worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple.	1.0808035894646535
I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament's comments.	0.7715795890042632
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means.	0.8323415063051256
The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government.	0.9292642508334547
Such transactions, according to the argument, bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables. This has also just been underlined by Mr Désir.	0.7844321124358631
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function, the coordination of scientific information in the EU, and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States.	0.7962869332570932
Mr President, Commissioner, we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons.	1.0779820843106225
What is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community, and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible, and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement.	1.0281566517340504
Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council, as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state, in maintaining international peace and security.	1.1200460639766365
The calculations are in decades rather than years.	0.27645373499996706
Indeed, it was fuelled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international, public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by.	0.780407878073565
Obviously, in the wake of the introduction of the euro, we need to create an integrated European financial market which is similar to the American and Japanese markets.	0.9705153971460907
Mr High Representative, you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki.	0.8510549231626869
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes, as we always do, of course.	1.0374256381412537
That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services.	0.6778838738653841
The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States' policy.	0.8834519844534358
It should seal their revival.	0.34834838610858593
As to the second comment: regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B, I wish to inform you, to confirm, that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects, particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage, in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one.	1.0838659255837706
When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels.	1.1838638006786428
The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.	0.9270529688468196
Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed.	0.6577162765006165
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.	0.7449703123827087
This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances.	0.989645520107035
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds, as we said at the time, and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament' s prerogatives and competences.	0.9814255234812677
When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment.	1.1252486189806232
Negotiations will start no later than 2002.	0.4350368935269381
The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far.	0.7179381719954354
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it.	0.7865311999086473
My group will not be supporting those amendments.	0.6938946010748517
This cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions, which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy, transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	0.797662597399743
The Council' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part, of the costs of recovery and recycling.	1.142515783475792
For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes.	0.7979848380196362
As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules.	0.7117945796100331
Madam President, Commissioner, a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules.	0.7392787476651227
In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges.	0.4008740507196053
The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership.	0.8254670798961609
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there.	0.690990328927447
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.	0.8698221404570925
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.	0.9525815718006871
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing.	0.9988459004625289
The Lomé Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates, which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, notably on the former colonial powers.	0.6437954904967126
I would ask for that to be checked again.	0.7490884310974787
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example.	0.5811035358467219
There is an immense risk of exclusion.	0.6103153100905274
Since January 2000, there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans, loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults, one leading to another murder, while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults.	0.7706581187981232
However, out of all the points, two specifically require our attention, and they are closely linked: peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe.	1.1325526710383422
There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture.	0.7780350233363227
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.	0.8642853763211664
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person, i.e. the vehicle owner, who pays.	1.097427709741335
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days.	1.1288779650319165
Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity, far more so than any transport directive, however important it might be.	1.0970445342305717
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.	0.6778730209014734
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle.	0.7853125845207778
Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President, with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002, and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.	1.0565465981833373
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.6315466471502549
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune.	0.9623361785949622
I am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect.	1.2904974806054865
Madam President, I welcome Mr Corrie' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly has carried out over the last year.	0.9894462858327505
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising.	0.6268246723112684
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom, not just about repression.	0.877856961794206
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament.	0.7945835176286996
This means that we move away from shredding.	0.8154247034540767
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy, real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream.	1.116006643189779
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .	0.5911832082794318
Mr President, colleagues, a happy new year and millennium to you all.	0.7883435563362721
It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers, millions of service users, in a great rush.	0.8621843136555674
The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.	0.9968102208340707
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel.	0.8616386553324811
We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender.	0.46230230628097346
Mr President, it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission, and I will refer to this later on.	1.1552468625796626
The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004. This is not enough.	0.9001150998055827
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0132/2000) by Mrs Bonino and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the Commission communication on the strategic objectives for the next five years	0.8212394506660592
Moreover, it is all just words, because the Socialist governments, which are now in a majority in Europe, are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments.	1.118185523618539
Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process.	0.9468610138716297
On behalf of the House, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament.	1.1732891778096708
I worked in Africa 30 years ago, and it was poor and underdeveloped but the problems are now more catastrophic.	0.9001807594492576
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament.	0.8933725850681162
The Commission and the Council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in Cyprus to undertake joint projects.	0.9451354344887604
We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies.	1.0463070874031708
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment.	0.9962913089496099
I believe that, as a beginning, Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide. It should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support.	1.0003813465453961
The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol.	0.8018265898188197
Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks.	0.4281404582926892
The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now.	0.5760463182053825
Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders, as well as Syria' s integrity.	0.9791282865449242
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those.	0.4932558289810015
Firstly: a regulatory framework is needed, which spells out very clearly the rights which the EU intends to secure for its citizens.	0.8366747249986393
There has been a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world.	0.9792672473062884
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.	0.8099096134232823
Gordon Brown, MP, meanwhile, has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel.	0.5480024514731674
On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.	0.9837889722208849
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group.	0.9229800355548958
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves.	0.7899017471943369
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security.	1.1938828026941017
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report.	0.7054143379228789
Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.	1.0504990823199907
And I would also say this to you, Commissioner: please, deliver the beef even if it is British.	1.0273259710049023
It is good for us that we have the power to do this, in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied.	1.2546037022346723
Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying.	0.8503439817985061
In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.	0.9126949530060725
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.	1.0767670716753204
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities, thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities.	0.7892986991961922
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide. I hope I can add that we will want to provide that.	1.038902461666217
What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment.	0.9864531149563296
Mr President, firstly I must thank Mrs Belém Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject.	1.0236192509136344
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that.	0.6927678348751669
In 1998, 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed.	0.75084929969935
In this respect, the Commission' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this.	0.7237621709778345
Otherwise, in my view, we are beavering away at the symptoms, but not the causes.	1.1678499662694746
This social freedom, which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor, gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability.	0.8910223196506838
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	0.8213060742235585
There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all.	0.8249979984598103
These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems.	0.5165549913356595
We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again.	0.9031379834299134
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.	0.5315779246805418
Mr President, I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting, which betokens peace and happiness.	0.8940563428472246
Mr President of the Commission, allow me to close with these words: as the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, we have every interest in a strong Commission.	0.9981754845739168
I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work.	0.6607962202213017
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.	0.9719270639524756
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.22720192548862345
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.	1.0012036283920702
This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.	0.948073109209996
When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope.	1.0265308037310368
There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions.	0.873164190623067
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa.	0.6943097277354836
Firstly, is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners?	1.0568655936457043
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential.	0.8201445399959173
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially.	0.9260207501857507
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting.	1.1514252837624541
This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period.	0.8991742596093939
In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty.	1.35606178294082
We should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency.	0.7863275959217081
With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries' special economic and social limitations.	1.0087983051250209
Eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty, the end of the nation-state, and so on. But the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in France, including British student, Isabel Peake, who was thrown off a train, shows why we need mutual recognition.	1.0611433256202145
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	0.8768958789822396
I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows.	0.9652076861574448
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.	0.6922467289227444
Ten years ago, the "velvet revolution" proclaimed Havel na HRAD.	0.5596332667432891
The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another.	1.0329581187889694
This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region.	0.9120210437419419
I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today, and not about the Geneva Convention.	1.0199401473850278
In saying all of this, I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems.	0.8819331554078182
May I quickly add something to the answer given just now by Mrs Wallström to Mr Martin?	0.5958868445981579
A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000.	0.6516041546844975
Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned.	0.7573620196110943
My second question is of a critical nature.	0.7241602953840037
The second priority, which several of you have stressed, Mr Puerta in particular, but there were others, not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority, is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment, particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.	1.097478146215205
I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments.	0.9981869025047568
As such, state aid costs the government twice: first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit.	0.5849881925951446
I should like to have an answer to that question.	0.9095575943476358
Ladies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear: in the context of subsidiarity, the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.	1.0969367881591925
The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development, clear requirements, controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers, this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time.	0.8132504224407109
The situation is badly managed.	0.6313240596073246
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic.	0.8951264982596503
Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000.	0.8976736089509895
This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake.	1.4035562078820105
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission.	0.8064842610303383
I find the opposite the case.	0.48305313380530995
The collection, sorting, transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension.	0.621963555565372
Is this the text which you will be submitting, or an amendment to the original version?	1.0909495353289267
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.	1.061707696003454
In any event, these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party.	0.67122398744939
I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war.	0.9202376072078272
We will, however, consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities, together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey.	0.8799478377006402
This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature.	1.0485633266739915
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective.	0.9404105611467031
It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision.	0.7169244737267007
Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.	1.062354369712113
Mr President, I am taking the floor to express my opinion, drawn from my experience of municipal administration, that the URBAN projects should, or rather must, have a threefold purpose: firstly, to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic, old and perhaps dilapidated areas of cities.	1.0211643327572881
So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism' and 'superstate' are not mentioned at all.	1.01341101265431
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.	0.43165555185101695
Russia' s new strong man, however, added a rather puzzling comment to this welcome declaration: 'As far as I am aware, Mr Babitsky already feels free.'	0.8360161991339972
It was never the responsibility of the farmer, it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again.	1.0274059298104659
More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border.	0.8534050790704915
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation.	0.7944498255189719
What about the infrastructures?	0.3526756861933214
Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services.	0.8857787421254959
In Europe today, the tourism market contributes 5.5% of the gross national product and occupies a rather significant proportion of the workforce, approximately 6%.	0.7702905313925777
The debate is closed.	0.20457118145337488
The Committee on Women' s Rights paid particular attention to the issue of education, because according to official figures women account for 53% of those engaged in tourism services, and in parallel, they form a majority among the working people most easily affected by social and economic change.	0.989412096798606
It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons.	0.8465560154186471
As regards the precautionary principle, I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon.	1.2173256451738441
To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has, since it gained new currency, become relatively devoid of meaning, but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed, amongst other things, is an integrated approach in the countryside towards, for example, tourism and agriculture.	1.0821819650535103
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity.	0.6685833647362402
It brilliantly illustrates the political dimension of a partnership which constitutes the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north-south relations.	0.6336479989946127
This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world.	0.7630096781186506
When Sweden joined the European Union, it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages which travellers can bring into the country from other Member States.	0.685743904577767
They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years.	0.6224479084198284
Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times.	1.3405505026043312
Therefore, the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure, including possible action by the committee responsible.	1.1428224135380367
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers.	0.7728926565246986
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless.	0.8169914244722921
A further round was held in January this year, starting on 31 January, and a third round is scheduled to start on 23 May in New York.	0.84289328544838
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union.	1.1050742945961685
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation.	0.7321134635031804
In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission.	1.0596741102556602
Cederschiöld report (A5-0020/2000)	0.28571732938932654
- (SV) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	0.9896782629890342
In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities.	0.9174795021929796
Our policies in Africa lack coherence.	0.4655411898046657
This is the crux of the matter.	0.6017804060608591
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors, esteemed European Commission?	0.6737440599968797
Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations.	0.7078446781161571
I can gauge its importance for my country' s international reputation.	0.4552564870478285
These will take place at a later date.	0.830824374579934
At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism.	0.9476289087500174
It is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in Europe, which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves.	0.9310239806537637
As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years.	0.8537011600204752
Clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level.	0.7271452262858941
This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina.	0.8663310430275165
Mr President, I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development, known as URBAN.	0.9892074401072013

These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.	0.7730727275354666

He was under the impression that the Syrians thought that, in exchange for the Golan Heights, all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt.	0.7141778934855858
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B, involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000, which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems, from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted.	0.9153103453671563
It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process.	1.001850742233334
At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.	1.183247108992437
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand.	0.8799350058011763
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.	0.4087381997747136
When implementation of the programme begins, I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full. I believe and hope that, despite the assault on us all of the new technology, literature will maintain its status.	0.9613518826624353

With regard to Parliament's various resolutions on the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which Parliament held last year.	1.039157529814132
In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy.	1.2831559782455222
The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar.	0.9457712583796107
I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said.	0.9328655415467204
The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)].	0.6518635007551478

This window of opportunity involves combining various factors, one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union.	1.056574919662597
Various Member States have taken one-off measures to be able to meet the criteria.	0.7775367692362581
Everyone recognises, indeed this was the theme of today' s debate, that, if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level, it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policies. I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council, for the Commission or for Parliament alone.	1.271567966821496
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.	0.7958753676328137

The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is calling upon all politicians, in particular those like you and me, President Prodi, for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics, to reconsider a development process, which, in addition to economic profit, takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account.	0.933823424917112
If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania?	1.136722223827312
There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation, discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced.	0.8740516526132676
Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended.	0.8501347849997354
The Commission' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union.	1.125164951808993

This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur' s initial draft report were adopted in committee, particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.	0.7352487104880644
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework.	0.8419414904353775
The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol.	0.8801409238143668
For these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the report.	1.0281065553446345
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable.	0.9384314168827896
Once again, I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place, one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau.	0.9230373969595038

In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail.	1.0039374905955611
I must add, however, that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States.	0.7333317506675652
That makes it a question of health, not just approximating laws, which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152, that is to say with codecision by Parliament.	1.2555358365406633
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world.	1.0591702592519465

I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales.	0.871673965800488
I would simply like to say that the Portuguese Presidency has, in these two short months, organised the first Development Council, admittedly an informal one, whose agenda was rightly dominated by EU-Africa relations. Indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen Member States to meet in Lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered.	0.8710737116028427
The term 'tourism' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun, sea and holidays, which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level.	0.899231152981935

(DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development (URBAN).	0.9311989977293084
It is not a very time-consuming matter, but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays.	1.2031948863751363
Never have the parties been so determined.	0.3745604441966362
Nevertheless, I must make it clear that all these actions will, of course, have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries, so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	0.9065535365036945
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow' s vote.	0.927746845788917
In 1999, we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union, which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere. This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime, in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation, including the cost of justice.	1.0062321184547443
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the European Union is aware that the resources it has devoted to Kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within.	1.0148602493276977
I also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements, which we must solve.	1.4008097108117732
As an islander, however, I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.	0.616536487559274
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.	0.9777210093954639
This time, however, it is true.	0.8327741945048553
Mr President, this is an important and urgent matter, and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly, because today, you must realise, men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero, these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid.	1.1833872066729232
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.	0.7408963430055708

In March, the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague.	1.0440828543795182
Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.	1.0758215205644872
That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place.	1.1624541404136017
Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead.	1.0562788070884914
In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made.	1.1810358013529103
We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.	1.0655395085096526
Clarification of this kind is missing from the report, which is unfortunate.	0.9975266966216303

I want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not, we must wait and see how it works in practice.	1.0714585676961548
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place, but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high, in reality no one would apply for the card. Alternatively, I might have no directive at all.	1.1638536205253325
However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union' s democratic role.	1.0572585962644405
I should like, naturally, to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached, i.e. agriculture, the main water-consuming sector. Agriculture must accept its share of 'polluter pays' charges, and has in fact already started to do so, but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints, especially in arid regions.	1.1339662678452105

On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and in particular with Greece, has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too.	1.1549111257118387
I do not know if you are aware, representatives of the Council of Ministers, of your responsibility over these last few years, and in 2000 as well, for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular.	1.117590686177441
Mr President, this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations, contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level, and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement, I repeat, I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary, inter alia, for negotiating and concluding an association agreement.	0.8882718445014428
Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report.	0.6218362708555557

No human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the acolytes of the new world order are saying today, the new world order which reigns almost unchallenged in financial circles, in international institutions, in the media and cultural networks, and in educational institutions, to mention but a few.	1.1126484291992362
Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle.	0.8556064181970724
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy.	0.8100045229793799
Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.	1.0130517289732364

'Restore hope' , do you remember?	0.66470482385786
There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them.	1.0942392602164313
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result.	0.8265495292228929
I am surprised it has even been made, because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents.	0.7800525383571019
That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference.	0.8207016623107322
In this sense, I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou' s proposals.	1.1130030779717155
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands.	1.1912935903394437
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important.	1.0542753491358556
We are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, as expressed at Tampere.	0.9029495290552105
Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states.	0.7483050896561095
I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report.	0.8437484769443803
However, politics exacts its revenge, and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda, it comes back in, as a matter of fact, through a door, and through the front door in the case of Austria, since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance, xenophobia and forms of racism.	1.045441324409619
In addition, it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO, as a matter of urgency.	1.282758557029145
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work.	1.0874697017106165
First of all, I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly, but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control.	1.0706243187359983
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative.	0.7869913912924167

It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions, that is to say job creation measures, special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.	0.8132235881035156
If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay?	0.7995803136718583
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.	0.7693259355795418
In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition.	0.9981558589301386
As I did not fully understand the plan, I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Rato, in a letter of 14 December which I have here, to ask him for more information on the document submitted.	1.1945730191545687
the oral question (B5-0004/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Council, on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax	0.944955693460407
Whose turn is next?	0.23811322310077943
We must give them all our support to reach that goal.	0.6663351028556124
It is about artists' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products.	0.6523099233035052
We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European?	0.9172046083849883
Unfortunately, what is most interesting is that the report, which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy, instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere.	0.9347340238914956
Mr President, we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission, but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion.	1.1639006770239666
Since Amsterdam, three terms have taken centre stage: complementarity, coordination and cohesion.	0.5432762644919829
I will verify this point and, if you wish, I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick.	1.0741810868569601
I referred to the case of Italy, not only because the President is very familiar with it, but because Community statistics (Eurostat) themselves reveal that not only has Italy' s welfare expenditure - currently 25.9% - been below the Community average (28.2%) since 1990, but that it has also been well below that of countries considered to be doing well, such as Germany (29.9%) and France (30.8%).	0.9036098403097691
It is, therefore, with good reason that we bring this up here today.	0.7069346516408069
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people. There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations.	1.0410672857660632
All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds.	0.8730982000495953
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here.	1.2397958618971558
The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue: we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell.	0.7092674746164718
In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances.	0.9093349032560183
Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality.	1.0590471399440475
That is why it is so important.	0.999097565071692
But I am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this Parliament and that the aforementioned Committee, of which I form part, has not been involved in this.	1.1910685812189319
Straight away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees, from all the committees, but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives.	0.9999836878418613
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart.	1.011130068936061
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.	0.8810963648441783
This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium.	1.1666404701592081
I would also like to support Mr Titley' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area.	0.6661188729615855
Finally, I have certainly believed for a long time, coming from an agricultural background myself, that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place.	0.9993893361762265
In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental.	0.9003543278105383
And, for want of appropriations, we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop.	0.8896880774772921
Of course we need to modernise these systems.	0.8201223098276966
On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card.	0.9709394801037263
(NL) Mr President, I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger' s speech, after which I will, of course, listen with all due attention to the next speakers. If you allow me, Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate.	0.9800869771724636
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.	0.7037299738242905
Of course, words can make a bit of a difference, a point that was made by Mrs Malmström.	1.0723456910157234
Madam President, you have said several times that this is a very serious problem.	1.3471592456794963
To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices, but not just anything! Most especially, I am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if Europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which, in the 1960s, made me a committed European!	0.9511162981233193
The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU.	0.8443003925960139
Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth.	0.6262985649338396
Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.	0.7859419909565263
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.	0.805054182831762
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab.	0.48014205575047986
As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics.	0.9341877638141329
The silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption, violence and war.	0.6523605127019598
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up.	1.0126110430673534
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves.	0.9812653412500447
This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning. It will also, and above all, be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union' s institutions towards the public.	0.9846241830851978
No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a substantive problem.	1.2520230985606182
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?	0.8653875315711119
We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and, of course, about refusing to use outside service providers.	0.8066713105532943
We need organisation and statistical monitoring.	0.27659725481352143
At this stage in the discussion, please forgive me if I cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me. I would ask that we be judged on our results, when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future.	1.1162166156098878
It seems to us that these limits are justified: firstly, by the need to diversify investments; secondly, because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time; thirdly, in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds.	0.9374625358041889
I know that we do a great deal of good, but let us start with this very essential aspect.	1.086883677159523
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.	0.7025112001291257
How do these operate within the European Parliament' s delegation to the ACP-EU' s Joint Assembly?	0.8384550873255037
Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers.	1.0540999491536645
The UN has a peace plan.	0.44755890882101784
Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report.	0.9941059239935295
Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention.	0.9172564351138403
Having said this, our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents. This invites the Commission to present a report within six months.	0.9589322898522779
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made.	0.8072619796161689
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute.	0.765017859790217
The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents.	0.8694838501837536
The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.	0.7303991548048863
We will soon have our first opportunity, and an excellent opportunity it will be, to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one.	1.1829296933267106
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.	0.9700058998791765
In my opinion, funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions.	0.636931605783012
On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements.	0.8923523027423154
No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms.	0.7246905853789423
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002.	0.8571250343135767
The subject in question is of great political and social importance.	1.1030225297550698
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals, as well as of other dangerous substances and materials.	0.7414486944032416
Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included, as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area.	0.9358890090180347
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations.	0.9417950949193558
It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make. These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe, as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric.	1.1666848617446426
In my country, Austria, new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach.	0.7425242000078817
This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today, furthermore, is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also, have developed and changed.	1.1042638853352071
Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties.	1.2128361599457376
Relating to Friday, on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the Group of the Party of European Socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels, as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda.	1.0589326255242244
Mr President, the Director-General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies, before this spring' s paper on development policy itself, is like putting the cart before the horse.	0.8687239505070217
After only a few weeks, Mrs Rothe, it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this, but in any case, I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail.	1.0308267325397908
These are real problems, but they have all been dealt with.	0.931937106924057
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example, has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid, accessible via the Internet.	0.8509156475799468
Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report.	1.0956260771864428
These are significant texts, adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty, which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, sex etc.	0.7538399956749586
And the more consumers invest, the brighter the prospects will be in the European business money markets.	1.0945359832808763
The debate is closed.	0.18814889098016402
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda, and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties.	1.072064928971828
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious.	0.9825402528184126
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.	0.9098452903424333
This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation.	1.1867657568176107
This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People' s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it.	1.0094553941631137
In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone.	1.0702289497908484
Furthermore, although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme, the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed.	1.0046531773819747
Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur.	0.964774265067393
Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate.	1.042477600071627
The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer.	0.7841118537921911
Despite this, he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question.	0.6605559704166184
We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made.	0.47126129392072935
Mr President, the majority of the borders, which have divided Europe for centuries, were artificially created, separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion.	0.7915022194439446
While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs, the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola.	0.9104085064929692
This is a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom, security and justice will be recognised in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.1552289921147512
As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union. The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe' s development process.	1.3232118015619057
Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable.	1.1765758455090602
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.	0.9693305693666339
Mr President, I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work.	0.8918458610442748
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament' s position.	0.6287083650982176
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner?	0.9009330338152995
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop.	1.154730577026534
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development.	0.9535125149056034
For that reason, as Mr Karas also said, we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value.	1.0825063898100522
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example.	1.1036035859750735
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States.	0.6767222940142571
I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs.	0.6336411351403548
This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market.	0.9510940293915443
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe' s meagre resources.	0.5602663057187293
For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores.	1.1207249682558689
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time.	0.8254634811987831
One could do so once or twice, but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well, for there is a very large hole, as yet unfilled, that we are unable to fill.	1.0790762238372396
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.	0.8772852078872282
The aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes, and the poor majority does not benefit at all.	0.8350130424201482
Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities?	0.7935590152726147
Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that I was Mayor of Bilbao during the nineties, which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the Commission.	0.858557647862577
The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action.	1.0148278409750595
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs.	0.5755243527064968
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action.	0.9612694811905661
They need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.	1.0308030759377391
We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.	0.7826178205108194
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies.	0.9662241596964981
We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater.	0.619147753240203
This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant.	0.5732183763271732
This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services.	0.9520174377068152
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel.	0.9533384850135236
Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.	0.9461442959533857
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules.	0.998093207317574
This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.	0.8281036346185919
Furthermore - and I agree with the assessment made by Mr Di Pietro - the Council' s text would appear to be overladen with contradictions, inconsistent propositions and omissions.	0.8742382403007474
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy, and will be applying a number of tests.	1.080208528364466
The presumed killer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake, who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents, and another young woman, Émilie Bazin, who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived.	0.7865577244252171
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.	1.0830006127223113
These are the modern means to be used.	0.9446454284147111
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians.	1.0326936181833632
In its present form, the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets, in spite of the fact that what is most important is to restrain them.	1.0790724345717688
I conclude by saying, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task.	1.132851291393421
I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims, alimony claims and non-contested claims.	0.6450363200628675
The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved.	0.7493761788499127
Today, we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities.	0.7816625351482096
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service.	1.0575182222940551
As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests.	0.4162871851198644
A second observation, the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes.	0.8222992269750629
In this context, we are convinced that we need to move away from the post­colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid. I say this because we know that, in Europe, development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States, in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states.	1.1817399225546146
In other words, social security is a factor of production.	0.8256886813519398
This may be proclaimed in the course of this year, with or without Israel' s support.	0.8869309694972527
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo?	0.854057962894516
On the whole, I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise.	0.8048705486836409
On the common agricultural policy, the biggest culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms.	0.9891514773713551
Cuba has just knocked at the door, and, if Cuba is also accepted into the ACP-EU community, that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in Cuba itself.	0.8873806023968837

Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957.	1.0366393950838215
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months.	0.5699490355420074
However, it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80% of the anchovies, which, until 1995, were being fished in the Portuguese fishing grounds, through an agreement between that Member State - Portugal - and France, should now be fished in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea.	0.9239549678314033
Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition.	0.9878576415926541
I myself had an opportunity to meet this group, for the first time, in parallel with the January part-session, and I am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions.	0.8990672395673985
I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage. This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust.	1.0472886485508113
Mr President, the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages, mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-use, the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials, etc. I think we have tabled a sound proposal.	1.0259902878065865
But we also believe that, in many cases, the proposals put forward by the Commission and the Council represent too much of a step backwards, which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us.	1.1457269872991105
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors.	0.5732105594631884
Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can.	0.7672098301845112
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions, and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny.	1.039756979390603
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	0.8934995867919392
More specifically, however, I would like to express our delight at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion.	0.9044165634172388
This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission.	0.9083965244995958
When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish.	1.1405123140162967
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it.	0.7907854241017805
States can carry out port inspections.	0.36979793072872047
At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs.	1.1102914994814548
With the framework directive on water policy, we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU' s water legislation.	0.7999144100504655
Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way.	0.9374281423403905
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.	1.121756326206202
Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest, as required by of our government bonds, made returns of 5.2% a year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996.	0.6465636697859005

Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become.	0.9814165567262404
What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis.	0.973594847759283
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.	1.1429351467034667
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.	0.8404815343668509
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency, we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8654990610162461
However, it is also a question of political agendas.	1.1275678295532838
. (IT) Mr President, the approval of this agreement with the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council decision on comitology marks the end of a saga which has kept Parliament busy for two years, along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the Union, whom many people do not hesitate to call masochists.	0.958969996011469
It is also worth noting that International Women' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years.	0.8538911608047434

There are two reasons why we are saying no.	0.7922626020942841
Commissioner, do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo, are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises?	0.8222078756073276
I think they should have.	0.8733963541278067
This is Angola' s reality.	0.41348702616275057
Similarly, it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent.	0.9045828628132487
In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States.	0.9266541749667727
In that context, I want to ask the following question of the Commission' s and the Council' s representatives: is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate?	1.1518122740781127
Yes, e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs.	0.9557060787307896

The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority, of States and peoples, in order to increase the Commission' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States.	0.964168548548257
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.	0.9784015436452759
If we do not, we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent.	0.9201220628127368
In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model.	1.0358742352782975
Without these prospects that we have outlined, Europe would, once again, have no future.	0.9074202938196454

Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.	1.1770576862556839
And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives.	0.8961445844757806
However, the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct.	1.2168275735027076
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto.	0.9590418628873194

Their expertise, is, of course, superior to that of the Commission.	0.765439801792272
Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people.	0.7736698654547639
Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU's financial support for less well-off regions.	1.0147215181218912
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament.	0.9577462444985688

One reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the leopard cannot change its spots, i.e. in the case of this framework decision, which specifically relates to judicial cooperation, the Council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation.	0.8817876539087056
However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority.	1.0556719290193122

Mrs Lucas should do the same.	0.527932382197458
- (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties.	0.8446355061916835

I understand very well what you are saying and you are right: the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation.	1.0639852792169378
Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase.	0.69103640978756
A month ago, the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment, as prescribed in the Treaty, in order to implement Article 13.	0.9961509442384713

Quite simply there is no question of this.	0.566231702280183
We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment.	0.6719481453096978
Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria.	0.9557537875340099
It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy.	0.46109401179645654
Thank you very much.	0.4413945576262794
I think this proposal is a good one.	1.1557941257051803

The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget.	0.7741126165823778
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system.	0.8978844879185399
It is a miracle that they were saved.	0.9428852258500016
Madam President, I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties, and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.0774791922509515
This is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island.	0.7488175533678579

Both LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, which were implemented in the 1990s, were ingredients of the new CAP that emerged after its review in 1992 and, along with other respective measures, they constituted the so-termed second pillar of the EU' s rural development policy.	0.9064578827086502
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them.	0.44496964877506673
This proposal can therefore be approved.	0.44689023434884256
These programmes have, therefore, been important channels for participative democracy, the rationale of the citizen for Europe.	0.7800648651478295
Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.	0.9790980730560309
So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all, keep our promises to them?	0.8721776226086747
We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions.	0.7864242475650172
I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica.	0.9292613491089207
Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.	0.914549605499576
Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action, which during the directive' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business.	0.6823245896784669

Mr President, at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that the main demand of the time, that of a woman' s right to vote, should be linked to the women' s question as a whole and that (as also stated in the relevant resolution) Women' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for.	0.876809500125739
Subject: Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000, and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical.	0.790483960487847
We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months.	0.9749368894432933

Subject: Surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes' worth in 1998), mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent.	0.8676693344958111

This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given.	1.00883769099211

In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has, in my opinion, developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention.	0.9419781283616155
In all modesty, I would claim that this is something that documents that the Commission is willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests.	1.0086938170177209
Nevertheless, I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed.	1.0986145122016981

Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned.	0.8758130526342092
We will come back again with material on these issues, because these problems, in one way or another, are here to stay, simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally-defined trade interests, etc. We have to reconcile those different approaches.	0.9220239408172631
The same cannot be said of the first proposal.	0.7503790543087252

As regards the first of these, it seems to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works, while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution, rental and the presentation of their works to the public.	0.9368610464210105

We therefore hope that the Commission, in the report it is going to present to us on global policy, will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests.	1.0672494681160163
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.	0.9692123722460138
The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies.	1.0485401163134345

I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.	0.9892715845723671

With regard to the parliamentary procedure, I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case practically all of them, although with some modifications.

So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do.	1.1848621172226443
Most of Parliament' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive.	0.874705401487661
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda.	0.6946862315909484
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do.	0.9786809136303736
During debates in committee, we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE.	0.7902827127771955
The Commission' s objective for the next five years is to become a 'global actor' by showing 'genuine leadership on the world stage' .	0.8066220893465829
Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years.	0.8357577058391168
We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done.	0.9431393706894164
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage.	0.7142006232186996
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us: in particular Commissioner Liikanen's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy.	1.0292536928958558
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your comments very carefully, and in particular to the rather emotional comments about Cyprus, especially in defence of the present legal situation in Cyprus, which the European Union specifically acknowledges by recognising the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.	0.9241388665446919
Obviously, he said "the federal solution would be best" .	0.7629414916225608
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas, however.	0.8441718870844797
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science.	0.8291649019714755
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did.	0.839097929947541
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality.	0.8874398737940298
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.	0.5701271085083469
If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times.	1.12521575049094
Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves.	0.7318347552078664
Madam President, as you know, the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors, particularly in the French version.	1.014533686032551
You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi.	1.2688661221290765
McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000)	0.3114829433281455
As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm, Mr Rapkay, that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American, Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation.	1.1590693256005469
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days?	0.9464336183872868
The common position is a reasonable compromise.	0.9972715091647998
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study.	0.6743773020408323
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money.	0.9967205140093927
But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands.	0.8798364585471183
There are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the so-called New Lands.	0.7280223922609415
Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action.	0.9099754335695974
Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered.	0.8048047132446383
One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest: will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture?	0.7367102308185299
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.	1.0028901940913866
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive.	1.1226111516623096
I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.	1.1429626428187356
Do not listen to the report' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.	0.7195992131808984
To identify the EC's priority areas of support, account has to be taken of the Community's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions.	1.0724475340273094
This indicates that we have a broad consensus.	1.144771163702969
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.	0.8146991022765433
Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.	0.995983389457039
Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members.	0.859167185975043
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy.	0.7300040191456636
Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children.	0.9026214718110983
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves.	1.1573455881321424
We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole.	0.8005030162537754
However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.	0.9802899935595398
That, however, is not my question.	0.9903837830370665
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	0.6506399237987956
And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect.	0.9803388252940988
This Chamber, and the European institutions, were build to uphold values, morality and a certain spirit.	1.0146709261182032
It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots.	0.9346928756564743
The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition.	0.9462825576566427
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided.	0.5959338350541232
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change.	1.1850961299675276
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.	0.8033437769625106
This is why specific action for women is needed, as well as mainstreaming.	0.9520139973415258
Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything.	0.4089780340469189
Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes, and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report.	1.0285884695219876
This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support.	1.014937296204867
In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values.	0.872933854177932
Mr President, as Mr Van Hecke rightly pointed out, this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples, and Parliament must speak up, especially vis-à-vis good friends, and the United States is a good friend.	1.2300300367139199
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think.	1.0458474063885617
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources?	0.7302992767060889
Quite, I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on.	0.9735585778111597
With regard to Article 5g of the other proposal for a directive, the so-called Article on Delegation, I think the Commission' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee, so I would support some of Mrs Villiers' amendments to this point.	1.0472658969538975
They want to see results.	0.7907151349464784
Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered.	1.166013236396439
Therefore, any modernisation process has to take account of economic, employment and social protection differences between the various countries, whether Member States or candidate countries.	1.053045683192364
It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions.	1.0149659751296711
It is based on three strands. strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions, at both internal and external borders of the European Union, on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing. strand B governs transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development, transport networks and the environment.	0.8869202490156584
We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro.	1.0312005236382338
I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification, for these four points are, in fact, to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought.	1.2000805209619547
Like yourself, he promised "less and better" , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered "much more and much worse" , and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise.	0.8399734000827858
On the contrary, we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms, in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note.	0.8440854070990068
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state.	1.159895241263228
Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission.	0.8913935984235273
Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament.	1.034318854289209
You realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned.	0.7283754354267983
How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating.	0.6490673607820394
Similarly, despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline, I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached.	0.7327137656198818
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation.	0.6026731539800347
Women deserve more than a quota.	0.6774484964455165
This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues.	0.7438048925641124
For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies.	1.0960696929485092
If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy, then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises, particularly humanitarian ones, are essential prerequisites.	0.9260050998661564
When it comes down to it, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough.	0.9418323196313505
The shift in meaning is not just semantic... The only logical thing to do on reading this document is to pursue the mass market and generalised deregulation and forget about the realignment of European policy which our citizens hoped for.	0.7717418821100825
At the same time, we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction.	0.9083751345234254
Mr President, having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market, the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other' s competence.	0.8262261597352044
What is left, for example, of the right of Austrians to choose their own destiny, if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner, as they were recently by you in Portugal, Mr President of the Council.	0.9187168588572914
Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention.	1.1024439438408185
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier, even when they are nationals of third countries.	1.0985703770413215
In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success.	0.8811567486416556
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Monica Frassoni' s report, according to which the European Parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the Commission about the implementing provisions for the Council' s decision of 28 June 1999 concerning comitology.	1.0873718703324866
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations?	0.9653816309104001
I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.	1.0709688533802395
I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions.	0.8843357343751378
I think that this is an extremely important point: this sense of conditionality, which underlies the European Union' s position, is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained.	1.2142362584400102
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments.	0.5662501822427266
Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria.	0.37843698469447784
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme.	0.9046114416055185
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation.	0.884819517566964
We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen.	1.0776751418213921
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction.	0.9018976053848823
The European Union' s water policy is not starting from zero.	0.7412677242474619
Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents.	0.7199721453460641
Since June of last year, the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities.	0.6251530203720552
- (SV) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism.	0.8500549370026955
Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment.	0.9768805193785907
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.	0.9237579429385311
I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them.	0.872836543672328
It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs.	0.9757251558904257
They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs.	0.6205500459490365
Lastly, the Commission has, in the recent past, had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently, as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely.	1.0105577123126852
This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised.	0.8043884269657767
I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic.	0.763957583190776
Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc.	0.8617505031551748
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.	0.8034219697249867
LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b, and 217 local action groups participated in it, with financing of EUR 1 155 million.	0.8324558260701057
I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty.	0.8573091191499969
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors.	0.6615841749364694
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious.	0.8603430121541464
The European Union is a system based on law.	0.8729968284336663
Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.	1.030753704825784
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.	0.9844083629290395
We do not, in principle, oppose this industry.	0.8110548859586365
It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis.	0.9310812380809007
The debate is closed.	0.21052717260363807
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling.	0.6846338901512175
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone.	0.6851210588174258
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF, particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.	0.8223465749278307
In this regard, we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas.	0.9512476728153396
We attach crucial importance to applying, if necessary, the new provisions under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which, by its actions, infringes fundamental citizens' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU' s Council of Ministers removed.	0.9163941939954261
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside.	0.9330541807568012
The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat.	0.5938305153289682
This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many.	0.9446074559682512
And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations.	1.0057474982924663
But we also say: we want to defend this European Community of tolerance, which is why a common foreign, security and defence policy is so important.	1.0709496453393705
Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.	0.669511489329446
The second proposal, on which the report is excellent, does not require any particular comment.	1.0810952853440985
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here.	0.5348147420276196
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.	0.5375702043503411
If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme.	1.0406893352995636
It is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full.	0.7901674318561965
Cross-border services	0.26763049363133495
Subsidiarity should make us realise that the state, exercising its governing functions, and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately. The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people.	0.925387108919049
All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work.	1.1455991109204295
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.	0.9808028361017304
It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality.	0.8472042893437854
Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies.	0.976522209121279
I do, however, have one small concern, when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets.	0.98352486448132
In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements.	0.8851059603876174
There is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner.	1.0268715982066934
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.	0.7857436652222635
The present CAP, however, is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis, granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy.	0.6995701784390806
Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant.	0.849237969977368
As the Parliament' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report, Mr Kinnock, I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process, and if I may say to all colleagues here, we have a very important task to do, which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness.	1.354042906210275
Next, we have flags of convenience.	1.0352024963947366
We must, however, admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory!	0.5110141486811685
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union.	0.5691561388393735
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.	1.1482251849403526
For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply.	0.7590406677512821
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime.	0.9894728792043281
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.	0.988314150228216
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	0.6395304232048604
A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks, that is the species of fish being affected, and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits. This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999.	0.8961837787874964
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.	1.1053772997779836
Nevertheless, it is still regrettable that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process.	1.1068503516832386
This is good, but it is not enough.	0.9194190809746426
This is why we are abstaining.	0.909589320234173
Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.	0.8816880278167485
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.	0.6335214252917298
Relating to Amendments Nos 22 and 24	0.5119710871671701
It is also clear that if we do nothing, our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner.	1.1668073741515972
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	0.28867259663827793
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today.	0.9778916244966368
Firstly, we wish to express our total support for, and our solidarity with, the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values, and not just the political force, which we have all built together.	1.3426541690732432
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence, which will be the key to future success.	0.7851718084960904
This is why we considered it essential to improve the report by means of our proposals deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmers in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriations in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural regions which were covered before. We also want to ensure that the new programme continues to prioritise the less-favoured regions.	0.9134148305151363
I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant workers of the region.	1.0003973363594845
Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits.	0.9308832318290653
This is my first additional question.	0.6743852444206008
In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken.	0.6299931383111199
Mr President, the only way to guarantee a high-quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service.	1.07751779657193
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication, namely the strategic approach.	0.8610297811027081
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past.	0.5063369923481497
First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection.	0.8806463488862837
For about 10 years, the situation in the area has been fluid.	1.150772007194131
As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence.	1.0428418466650735
We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past.	0.7985059349931516
As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements, we shall not be credible.	1.063160674756413
I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work.	0.7410996088005931
Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.	0.9470011755547998
There is a problem, however, which we need to address together.	1.2186815686304806
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER+ programmes run smoothly.	0.9635760304122218
President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements.	0.5915748252525413
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy.	0.4137595906526365
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity.	0.6954126203327379
What are we actually doing then?	0.5806000851844569
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence.	0.4579687778344539
He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner.	0.5147451551682134
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of, and the first ever debate on, the Commission' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so fond of; as I am -for the whole legislature.	1.0282767294981592
A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management.	0.6907961411311099
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities.	0.7448356376640256
Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law.	1.1179673673637716
Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky' s life and freedom.	0.9543857613635228
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States.	0.5374514413712189
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities.	1.046331831328246
The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time.	0.6572375678052823
I think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has, on the whole, been quite positive, and I would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the Third World on precisely the work in question.	0.9934196552673451
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU' s Barcelona process.	0.9340288594331996
There is a shortage of facts: we have no information on the economic impact, which still remains a complete mystery.	1.1954720364291072
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions.	1.0037191324951495
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.	0.575099909704965
Madam President, President of the Commission, this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe.	1.0558232367759623
We finally got here, on Monday at 8.30 p.m., after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling.	0.8365093603806515
Declarations of principle are not enough.	0.4044926967703252
Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one.	0.710444842040024
In congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work, we can but hope that the Commission will duly take into consideration the proposals Parliament has put forward, in accordance with the commitments made under the Code of Conduct on the implementation of structural policies, and that it will confirm, with fitting amendments, the transformation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries.	1.1465714938564693
The basis is monetary cooperation, which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy.	0.8999685221386285
The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed.	0.7869832938510499
The principle also concerns water charging.	0.38707234359549403
Madam President, I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation, and I am going give this explanation before the whole House.	0.949002719174777
This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it.	1.050489723737822
If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more.	0.8654187818355217
A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.	1.0684773434764838
Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing.	0.9492416144163108
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	0.9627421461567716
In my opinion, the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process.	1.0885621932512688
Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential.	0.9109475126877441
Mr President, there is a mystery.	0.9379115317763876
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.	0.9128911232238597
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport.	0.32140675612372166
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.	0.8026838658385594
Finally, the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised.	1.1645972941478022
You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions, while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks.	0.9882821279458054
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned, we shall abstain from voting, and where, finally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it.	1.0287366890162424
It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees.	0.8049471188195334
There are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test-bed, therefore, for integrating job creation strategies.	0.6942534025713311
We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey' s will as regards the European Union' s priorities in its foreign relations.	1.0889978189055047
The European consumer organisation, which has asked us to support the common position on this point, is to my mind letting the consumer down.	1.187756831911983
It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.	0.7492279981600808
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.	0.6353120826504096
The report on the experience acquired in the work carried out under this directive is part of our work programme for the current year.	1.167051036876874
The Commission' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced.	0.8693222034311338
However, Mrs Lienemann' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water.	0.8960861436124117
Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well.	0.8424161637188501
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.	0.8407833971229997
Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected.	0.9653493612480422
This question should be answered in light of the fact that the age-old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of courier companies and by technological developments, such as fax and e-mail.	0.580570025538253
In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action.	1.013097443993823
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed, you will be doing us a great service.	0.8514955164325995
As Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.	0.8945882591207349
We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable.	1.062496829056344
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.	0.7503421403224275
Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning.	0.9162061408593623
Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition.	0.6457452583444659
Secondly, because it can promote recycling, which is important.	1.1751130161482566
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.	0.3426238191297716
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time.	0.6453858253822362
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.	0.8001702473984333
It is very difficult for a Commissioner to try to work in an area where there are dozens of different organisations whose representativeness needs to be ascertained every time.	0.9706793263198261
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic, tyres and glass.	0.6972508562494699
Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive.	0.5964239603755339
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6314589899536381
The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators.	0.7130832940744544
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.	1.1112656668089027
I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70/524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001.	0.8010915046962378
I would welcome more concrete information on this.	0.6514165688029381
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses.	0.7480579772778136
More specifically, the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards, which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach, need to be maximised.	0.8774291895704419
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country.	0.8672331882548536
But it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated, and that action on this aspect will affect all the others.	1.0356707846599915
If the new Lomé Convention is simply put into operation, without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy, the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression.	0.9706364523585007
In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man.	0.9862992582421071
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.	1.0424346245309744
It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose.	1.0249773057900013
I am also grateful, at the risk of being repetitive, to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which, if she will allow me to say so, she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating.	1.0629947692335282
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.	1.0401619694503925
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.	0.9743007974354394
This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages.	1.0685378488391983
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.6164215874670445
It is a highly complex problem.	1.001480441920254
We take note and this will appear in the Minutes.	0.6919086108395317
Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English, that is quite a meaningless term.	0.9263634879560751
Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution.	0.4860980583101043
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance' ?	0.6934442870211202
We are recovering from a crisis. However, I believe that, in the future, it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme.	1.058675927723228
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters.	0.7611820296202542
The application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the Cypriot economy, especially in agriculture. It entails the liquidation of the public sector, and it dislocates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in Cyprus.	0.9714933220221779
I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda.	1.1299105439017811
Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission' s viewpoint.	1.185483614865766
This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details.	0.7442539827113827
As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated.	0.8376392317103116
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests.	0.7804309605430403
The lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector.	0.6190634633571025
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months.	0.9630786979124037
What has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive.	0.78560403177488
These cases keep occurring.	0.35897298066496297
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear.	0.9127291522431905
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned.	0.6704161839055092
We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives.	0.8234057651918901
We hope that this, at the least, will come about during the evaluation process.	1.0566154841516773
Our priorities (i.e. the "left-overs" ) must be:	0.7524348340249893
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.	0.9208857815011076
Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE.	1.0255805826827165
. Mr President, this has been a very useful debate.	1.1840925829999525
Things could well continue in the same way.	0.6276116208637388
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say.	0.9320913974556153
(Sustained applause)	0.160395676322035
There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate.	0.8353448289595073
For five years, I have been the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation, which assuredly does not have Parliament' s broad perspective.	1.136612152357663
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union.	0.838086558361512
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner.	1.04384670619514
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.	0.8745145127137963
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.	1.0627659029038932
I will be happy to come back to Parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached, or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved.	0.9258620146373686
If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point.	0.9473598743902195
Madam President, under Rule 29(4) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group.	0.8709522712063422
This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive.	1.2020394340386769
This was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	0.6904554951176886
Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria.	0.4269205747572521
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	1.0241438776414722
So I believe that we should take today' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10.	1.1902682967788856
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.	0.4005731753603946
I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions.	0.9040614956799933
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.	0.9821260565365147
However, further to the directive on common rules for Community postal services, the Commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament. We are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive' s application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current European postal operators in terms of both economics and employment.	1.200076604011362
More work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently on-going with the international organisations, such as the World Tourism Organisation.	0.8782027083433972
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious raw material.	0.7037827092432456
Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests.	0.6970229900381112
All these elements have to apply cumulatively.	0.6392757260268693
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker' s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service, is not a contradiction in terms.	0.9347103009927388
Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things.	1.1758461048163549
We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place.	1.092748713168665
Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics.	1.172746315426791
I would say the same about Amendment No 2, which we would also accept with a slight modification, since the idea seems to us to be basically correct.	1.1735176014234676
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January, then February, and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.	0.9365816918984894
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier.	0.8674506963616226
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.	1.1839772422036303
In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement	0.8734353247641624
The developing countries, too, expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide.	0.9675559624405761
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds.	0.9181916456366762
Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union is implementing in countries in that area, will create new problems there, new tribulations for their peoples, and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialists, we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM.	1.078461684638007
Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission' s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament' s legislative powers.	1.0190986134982567
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.	1.0219838734689541
That is what we are lacking, Commissioner: the political will to make a start in tackling speculation.	1.228797225022659
It will have to initiate these negotiations.	0.6440911137740343
It is also of great importance to citizens.	1.1077062050261526
Commissioner, far too little is said in your paper about regional policy.	0.6992568732341498
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment.	1.1127730664296451
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States.	0.3437577005340933
Given the already advanced state of these two countries, compared to other applicants, this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme.	0.8370366674030844
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts, for example with the United States.	1.0426863094348486
It is already included now: "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products".	0.7132488759382822
Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane.	0.7968697725333609
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.	0.6208472176450193
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already, for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, but also by others - there is a need for more supervision.	1.1240864549171574
(Parliament approved the request)	0.4389044491387239
In recent years, these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union.	0.6821159076095527
The quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria: is it decentralised, is it transparent, is it accessible to the citizens and does it work?	0.9917046087084161
Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you.	0.8969466800314075
The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work.	0.643740186153593
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point.	0.7049464258135465
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.	1.0886006572613263
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption.	0.8807580032096998
It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.	1.1008630691138714
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time.	0.8083445032681504
This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.	0.7687866119069334
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February.	0.950171557837705
However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts.	0.8120058582338089
They have now got to grips with "EU" .	0.7071807778979784
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice.	0.7282385680305823
There is an agreement to double this number, but I understand that, so far, not a single new person has arrived.	1.302064853330908
In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed.	0.9467081545322672
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management.	0.8572395940101233
What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.	0.8905373707294428
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future, for Europe' s economy, and, above all, for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.	1.088246607806313
No, it does not!	1.0232957232205357
The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House, holding a senior position within his delegation, continues to offer strategic advice to private clients, but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are.	0.7391979894803198
The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions.	0.9609720969658224
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks, not only for the initiatives of the different groups, of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, who proposed this debate, which has led to a positive and important discussion.	1.0369370820925188
These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects.	0.6312100987925728
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report, I have this important reservation.	1.142944949526693
Regarding a second matter, now, relating to the additional criteria, which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas. Here, too, I am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project.	0.9662987708046507
We failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext, I refer to article 2.7, which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts.	0.9527687717052625
Madam President, to begin with, I would like to make one thing abundantly clear: Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion.	0.8259762373233533
Of course we have pondered this issue, and we are still studying it extremely carefully, and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced.	1.1268168938520617
We think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective.	0.5588276245478325
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues.	0.6883702751210641
We need to change tack completely.	0.641929971851577
Finally, on the content of the debate, I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of its agenda.	0.8885826457179095
I agree with your analysis.	0.7849285171543747
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world.	0.7418001829107499
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform.	1.1636334792977865
Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view, I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning, as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue, it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States.	1.2023164276355205
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions.	1.0031999615587543
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter?	0.9216871532408765
The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure.	0.8320834750279948
Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place.	0.6376537156166355
There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.	0.8401008394991447
I shall now, therefore, put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote.	1.0161420275252462
Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East.	0.8728960927653809
But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis.	0.6632160276731578
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.	0.6458960774871998
Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security, and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based.	1.0747798407370404
They cover a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community, notably in key areas of the internal market; and they cover provisions on cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of fields, including justice and home affairs.	0.9727120213877603
Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament.	1.2190049200081117
In this context, it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said, namely a state subject to public control, and that it should be a democratic state.	1.1172241171121962
It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired.	0.8756636641073846
They cover provisions on the movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, current payments and movement of capital.	0.7371766980750725
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.	0.8660918438529337
However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.	0.7570418066939807
What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately.	0.5021349037790641
Such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this.	0.8193027703413976
It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition.	0.7389765663385184
The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated.	0.9223557966182396
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud.	0.8323180977422048
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster, a significant portion of which falls within Ireland' s only Objective I region.	0.7699869787459931
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice.	1.393682299181026
I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics.	0.7404559236785418
On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form.	1.2058999161252153
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage.	1.1682027307860146
We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists; on the contrary, we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and, hence, cost-covering prices.	1.0395734981815339
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.	0.47017831268270355
This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy.	0.7533448596102124
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses.	0.8015572861643083
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated.	0.5968778945674849
And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content.	1.0653961724879963
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully.	0.7464524102614329
Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson.	1.1613000323858431
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies.	1.0611730623547904
The "zero input" and "zero pollution" requirement, including for substances naturally present in water, is not realistic.	0.8995315552424117
I totally agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Schulz' s remarks, and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom, security and justice, without having to derogate from their own powers.	1.0182613981381934
The company' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying.	0.7077955107353051
Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.	1.0212733554093714
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes.	0.9782885330995721
As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court.	1.092110489519044
According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force, whereas Parliament's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years.	0.7906529432146278
Take the trade agreements.	0.45592083459253424
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure.	0.9684262625158198
As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken.	1.1107846642487058
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is.	0.7932538452281604
First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women' s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women.	1.1369129229001316
As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives.	0.7720103023278664
The same can be said with regard to transfers.	0.5908834214886737
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council.	1.1345905111124734
Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba' s application has the support of all the ACP countries.	1.0851366029082767
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary.	1.0056797806700384
However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement.	1.1073673933180717
It is proof, as if we still needed it, of the fact that immature diplomacy, which defends no interests, unless of course they are individual interests, and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs, is not just inefficient, it is positively dangerous.	0.986787502614261
Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team.	0.8207480963674234
(ES) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war.	0.8953697980500235
In the way it is structured, Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes.	0.7888378929823108
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK.	0.7518386110065599
Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement.	0.8978343730180817
Mr President, as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years, I have to contradict Mr Dupuis.	1.0616800190970088
With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.	0.9450907269086425
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.	0.6874578861052694
In this respect, the Commission supports Amendment No 22, as I have already mentioned.	1.2658880143272633
The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament.	0.898174123819699
Enlargement appears to be an end in itself, but unless decisions are made on a social policy, a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the Union, the Europe bequeathed to us at the end of Mr Prodi' s presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalised globalisation, rather than the community of destiny which we hope for.	0.9398824342919726
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner.	0.9822971664388587
This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world' s population lives, and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively.	1.06416164128333
In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop.	0.7296897520044638
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?	0.6954199892224961
Furthermore, it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey, in view of that country' s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union. It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations.	1.1998845230502357
It also emphasised the importance of abolishing gender inequalities and as I travel through Africa and see the work done by women I only wish there were more women in senior government positions and in presidential posts.	0.5926199526902859
It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy, but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.	0.8144200231316688
I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement.	0.8867854566752054
In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira.	1.108425818654592
Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry.	0.9968670115624956
The debate is closed.	0.06926186103858498
I conclude, Mr President, by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions.	1.0449703194814814
. The joint United Nations programme on AIDS estimated that by the end of 1998, there was a total of 33.4 million people in the world living with the HIV infection.	0.9672408714552216
Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' .	0.8711621013931046
Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma, where an elected President is imprisoned, parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered?	0.6666078171167896
This situation, as in neighbouring former Zaire, is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom. As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region.	1.049767352954401
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	0.7894467495506055
It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank.	1.0215708457822885
Mr President, I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it.	1.0967643917366376
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking.	0.5823084785943989
Mr President, I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report.	1.0651242921968656
Report (A5-0034/2000) by Ms Stenzel, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States establishing the guidelines for Community Initiative Programmes (CIPs) for which the Member States are invited to submit proposals for support under the EQUAL initiative (COM(1999) 476 - C5-0260/1999 - 1999/2186(COS))	0.753612116721219
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.	0.5283754458784804
The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, decided in December, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report, that we could waive our opinion.	1.1497395983409981
Should we not be discussing this issue?	0.7118805909006181
The same is true with regard to immigration policy.	0.5593354367127142
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card.	0.9653858501393219
Firstly, no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.	0.991388655935061
In this respect, the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment, and help us to realise our ambition, in the interests of environmental protection, the economy and creating new jobs.	0.96470480447253
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform.	1.010150601218653
But if that is true, then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward.	1.011171656206761
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available.	1.3482021680131728
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman.	0.47561252973001666
The Netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or, in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around, the manufacturer, has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with ecology; it is a simple question of competition!	1.0001584151130347
The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area.	0.8622708399658205
I will now describe, very briefly, the five areas where the most important changes may occur.	0.9712403830047289
We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them.	0.668566889385278
In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.	0.8193315773359311
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.	0.8507899024158679
However, the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms, particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe which, by itself and in coordination with the other European institutions, can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into specific actions.	1.163321184938602
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.	0.770829919753299
In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one.	1.025764340801496
It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied.	0.791918602339676
We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society.	0.8100240750471479
That is a reduction of 3¾ % compared with the previous CIs.	0.7806809158528223
We need to take this responsibility seriously.	1.1952168753896917
In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely.	1.1479706567530918
The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness.	0.7243674117306513
The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses.	0.6413494669339213
For safety' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob Söderman' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.	1.1036809642726937
(Applause)	-0.0
It has already attracted much comment, including reactions from Members of Parliament.	0.768315123778408
Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment.	0.9943635987523065
Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation, in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles.	0.8969276706766717
The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza.	0.6094453262861623
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done.	1.002893670258012
This brings me to my second point, namely the snail as symbol of our postal services.	0.727636214879946
Some of these parties, despite declaring themselves to be republican and democratic, adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right, either out of connivance or as a vote-winning ploy, if only in openly and hypocritically blaming the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment, and generally making their lives more difficult.	0.7873282404283787
This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament, which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission, must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the courage to say no, and it must say, Madam President, that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit, and in clear terms declare, without prevarication, its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in Austria, recalling the statement made on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who said that, if you are going to have to say no, then the best time to do so is right at the beginning.	1.0903151619479867
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda.	0.6513585745621847
It will reflect the European Union's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions.	0.9694441005795664
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found.	0.7944329381614257
A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us.	0.8954680916533311
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders.	0.9969457072665324
The form the aid takes is important.	0.4807661057392737
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol, and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved.	1.0855882206459022
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.	0.5002760196600375
We do need to rethink many aspects of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success. We also need 'distinctive strategic partnerships' with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace.	1.0079910461326018
Are you aware of this?	0.5850158388848511
Let us not deceive ourselves: a Europe, one part of which is being held back because of frictions, misinterpretations and conflicts, and because of nationalistic clashes, will never be a Europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants.	1.1543167010628874
It is, however, very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syrian authorities require from their peace patron, the United States, not to mention the heavy, equally costly, security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan.	0.9575501783123849
Obviously, I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here, but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case.	1.0197255969760963
Fine words, as is the case again today, but no report. It is too crazy for words, really.	1.3145664218778295
Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate.	1.1057219631822375
As for fishing, there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds, which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish, will certainly prove fruitful in the future.	0.9009753660173414
Question No 45 by (H-0041/00):	0.3182517797448153
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.	1.0537924884831709
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view.	0.861025352190707
Lastly, I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam.	0.8244377345490267
The other area of conflict is more difficult.	0.3661388656079231
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament.	0.881739080531866
Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position.	0.6180276079109406
However, before labelling we need clear rules.	0.6785815795757566
Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.	1.0654068832913197
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix.	1.1491469600677542
I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin.	0.9900894308615759
The timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable, but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance.	1.1733291968180797
The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished.	0.8540402697862596
This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs.	0.5916609525725708
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.	0.5064743548875594
The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard.	1.0017279034211408
As far as criminal investigations are concerned, for which I am responsible, I take note of the invitation that was addressed to the Commission and the Council by several Members of the European Parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis, having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts.	1.042400118899821
Mr President, we all want to do something about combating European fraud.	1.1169639572306311
This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour.	1.032606024867266
May he rest in peace.	0.25541979099668455
All these factors have unfortunately been accumulating over time and are now allowing those who are cruel, intolerant, racist and destructive, of which all our countries have some examples, but thankfully a minority, to light the fuse of xenophobia.	0.9306034109308944
But the reverse is also the case: a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth.	0.8694581072448709
The Arab world' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as, for example, Algeria' s fight for freedom against France.	0.5421535613815048
Against this background of extremely high expectations, I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step, namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia, is vitally important.	1.0558627631138926
This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union.	0.7104460587227426
In this respect, the issue requires closer examination, because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people' s suspicions.	0.9586156154798204
Agreement on comitology	-0.0
If revenue is lost, then public interest operations will be revised and cut, and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made.	1.053138951135784
Mr Rübig, as I said, I understand your concerns very well.	1.1062301514630084
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.	0.8323422835900975
The approach that we have been following in these discussions, and our participation in them, essentially turns on taking advantage of a certain desire to alleviate the tensions that exist, based on a conviction - which appears to be widely shared - that it is necessary to continue to negotiate, and that continuing negotiations and maintaining their impetus also give rise to hopes that a definitive solution can be found.	0.8967784886558733
And, when I say that the Commission took that view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria; and who, once again, demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission, under oath, in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning.	1.156663566886316
I want to see civil society given a louder voice.	0.6955541845629153
I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world.	1.0780885209985551
Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO?	0.9817395622028411
The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4 in principle.	0.807516564371223
The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States.	0.49239250728860773
Proposal for a joint resolution on coherence of different Union policies	0.8081682255882008
I will give some examples shortly.	0.7431010818353241
I do not have confirmation of this at present, and nor do I expect it, since we have not yet held direct talks.	1.1234011494274219
These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem, that is, to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements.	0.927504625409993
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time.	0.5387399483855767
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves.	0.9497632811025526
If not, then we will proceed to the vote.	0.7931934683329677
Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union.	1.0692137895329046
First of all, regarding the remarks of Mr Crowley, who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure ISD approach; the objections of the Commission to that proposal would be the following: such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non-consistent sets of rules; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest.	0.8312632335230238
Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities.	1.1029549717472473
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future.	0.8892476917964344
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question, but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982.	0.7085291224899646
We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.	1.0950401940667025
In this connection, I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108, in which the words "water pollution caused by individual pollutants" are replaced by "prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges" .	0.8059370630561581
But above all, the human rights policy is too fragmented.	0.9484358969925676
I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation.	0.7961692594167596
They must promote a decentralised, efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities.	0.7317962789939467
That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used.	1.081633583277187
Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity.	0.7755992586699183
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time.	0.827216076599935
Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children.	0.8160120555763167
With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo, we have already heard Mr Kouchner, on various occasions, describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure.	0.8398493450231085
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic, more transparent, and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding.	1.114170184445443
As has already been said in this debate, three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for.	0.7490519150732825
However, a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability.	0.9446998946943406
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally.	0.8030685608571395
We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba which respects the principles of the market, the sanctity of contract and the rule of law.	0.8414223628059014
Consequently, I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	1.0174647549589741
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised.	0.9532235158784043
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?	0.8177133191572281
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy.	0.859880881066319
A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them.	0.8907682619446776
My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.	0.991598229824936
Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts.	0.8344415754707151
On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994.	0.8952483019601211
As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.	1.0453987615423184
Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves?	1.001300667405835
This is therefore an aspect to be considered.	0.810116931580413
. (ES) Mr President, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur for his splendid work.	0.9638047730120223
Parliament voted in favour of this text.	0.6925625206304298
Wrongly done, the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality.	0.7171159321611467
Mr President, for years, Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	0.8133992559249178
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed.	0.7826534382153576
Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered.	1.0607447775186019
I shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote.	0.6767359865900289
Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of 'economic and social cohesion' rather than 'regional development' as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area.	0.9181742468194245
In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.	0.7131759264022509
Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you.	0.9011059799377911
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?	0.8170239823205959
Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster, at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned, on a par with Chernobyl.	0.9868228831292898
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism.	0.8955764688375926
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible.	0.5513923108795085
But creating parks with very limited financial resources, without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual.	0.6418979968036223
There is now a new Commission.	0.7706111739058433
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.	0.9508049403029415
On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them.	1.0003171681591625
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU.	0.9592342705120052
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.	1.0836989015566754
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding.	0.796221047934146
In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up.	0.8872571249565271
Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed.	1.2796679887543525
Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many, many more decades than companies from Japan, Korea and elsewhere, that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere.	0.7440777257597767
Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one' s office at European level.	1.001205481964451
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year.	0.8436486167544954
Oz' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press.	0.4854447471504302
Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region.	1.0605109196916975
That is the real difficulty which we must overcome.	0.972096836225134
Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.	1.060375088167192
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to.	0.5991516573705133
It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken.	1.0281649695077997
We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled.	0.48292186738152953
Then, last November, before the ceasefire was over, the Spanish Government spokesman, Mr Piqué, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country.	1.0085402134653159
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today.	0.8636769414943448
The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view.	1.0948363032217034
Bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the nearest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us.	0.7395808803192558
I should like, however, to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law.	0.8781663745257022
With regard to Amendment No 3, which we did not approve at first reading, I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives, conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid.	1.048937610402312
Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process.	0.8984342895609894
The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic.	0.5197647194945603
Three annual crops of Moroccan and African workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly EUR 2 million; and yet 60% of them have no running water in a region where, as we know, the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer.	0.8295290772960386
I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.	0.798594037071413
Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent.	0.7491001545849703
The latter would be well advised, however, to follow the good example of the Commission, for once, and make the same efforts in their own research programmes.	0.9809878560812186
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative, as appears from your contributions this afternoon, to formulate a single text.	0.8047520633606865
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on.	0.6120758315181684
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.	0.9889387471886959
Until now, the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh.	0.9335044004883553
I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs.	0.7981636411556808
The holocaust, fifty years ago, led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms.	0.8911260952020412
Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights, which has now reached the drafting stage.	1.197728959983983
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba.	1.1850996731412538
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe?	0.5220689360691133
At a time when, Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects, why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient?	0.8640698137363233
Moreover, these are factors which create employment.	0.7616636880934701
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.	0.7720216939246319
They have our full support.	0.456856010333828
Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because, if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive' concerning lending, borrowing, selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian, this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds, for example Swiss funds, would be eligible for investment.	0.885768197011655
Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions.	0.9761238878816358
Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are.	1.105792156117436
The best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment, as well as the legislation in the pipeline, rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in Directive 90/220 may not be fully taken into account.	0.8131547724234562
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers.	0.5699822317052441
Whether total or partial, privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse.	0.36189069754144915
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.	0.7191989615059684
Today, the Commission is obliged, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people' s demands for, and expectation of, transparency and, if the Commission' s regulation is adopted, the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration.	1.0146942676369015
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change.	0.6354336045197905
Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten?	1.0219922948669775
Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want.	0.9495038084588895
I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need, which has been expressed by all the political Groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue, one which is so dear to this House.	1.0533882814338018
The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge.	0.5604266268186717
Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino.	1.1037188274034835
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes.	0.7417370410908457
That is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken. Because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us.	0.9640751962788839
It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves.	0.8188598318552696
I should like us to take a leading role in this work.	1.0544791571902974
We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area, but we must do so with rigour, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs.	1.0004594820592416
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners, rather than competitors when it comes to policy.	0.8101751696961831
We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products.	0.9624968830030914
For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it.	1.0689378069268838
Of course, it is always possible, but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down, the idea of going to Court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in Italy is not very reassuring.	0.902092981282285
Furthermore, it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water, between different river basins, practically impossible in the future.	0.806229820050136
However, I would remind him that, during his inaugural debate, he described the Commission as a European government.	1.3059002310366945
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.	0.7854991407956882
Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Corrie, for an excellent report which I think very well describes and summarises the work which has been done in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the course of 1999.	1.080994519195104
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.	0.5878442675118796
Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.	1.0337628780390584
We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent.	0.38408431110712316
As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation.	1.0285045012009277
I have a number of ideas which should be put across.	0.858342230753573
Both of them have done a first-class job.	0.8207258569447948
This document stems from the previous Commission. It is undoubtedly the result of work carried out by Commissioner Papoutsis throughout his term of office and which culminated in the Luxembourg summit and his failed Philoxenia programme.	0.7619951829164758
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.	0.9695528757312882
However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1).	0.9124483144889797
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers.	0.91437482595307
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side, but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition, even though you stressed that this is not the case.	0.8103788335638817
As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.	0.8940496199782058
In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997.	0.8517099107737243
Mr President, all I can say about 1999 is this: how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter.	0.7532485837629903
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups. I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission, but, on the contrary, fundamental contributions, since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome.	0.9223544482548052
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important.	0.9724573360384284
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue.	0.5203977408783144
We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment.	0.8404302127086178
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security.	0.6077472740670731
Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring.	1.0249135402774563
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.	0.677191523291153
During the new programme period, in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations, such as ISPA and Sapard, it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries.	0.9442368099119797
I therefore hope, firstly, that our fellow Members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other.	1.2417771922450143
In common with the other Members, I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned.	1.0678375095949952
. (DE) Mr President, following this vote, I would like to ask the competent Commissioner, Mr Byrne, if, now that he has seen how much support there is in this Chamber, he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments?	1.0845360473782006
Mr Seixas da Costa, I totally agree with you.	0.8208944355263987
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined.	0.8667070787687262
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget.	1.094446541760673
That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand.	0.8059464169676458
This is why the National Front voted against the report.	0.9673050989828686
This applies to Amendments Nos 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104.	0.3931664592859689
Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office.	0.9684966422952186
We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht.	1.1336183722321642
In a short space of time Mr Schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within Parliament. I thank him for that.	0.9711700570806272
Quality products in order to improve competitiveness, sustainability in order to protect resources and innovation in particular through the use of information technologies.	0.6738479501712592
We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement.	0.7293794080356517
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world.	0.7442644774102475
The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.	0.931538240820401
Mrs Gillig, but others like Mr Markov and Mr Ésclope, voiced concerns about employment.	0.7251705560530821
However, I do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all Member States have approved Commissioner Monti' s proposal for minimum taxes on capital.	1.2075604287194421
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions.	0.7356337082445776

Secondly, encouraging exchanges, mobility and training in the cultural sector.	0.5587941393202238
Jörg Haider' s rise to power, with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government, is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth.	0.7665182456593189

I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter.	1.1223024536659356
Nothing has happened!	0.2381297743814538
Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003.	0.9486038080822626
Parliament' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious, European water policy for the next three decades.	0.9101731118960947
If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it.	0.8975832698581963
I propose that we start the debate immediately.	0.5677803328533998
It is only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now.	0.8508795408761838
Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself.	0.886639936432989
What, finally, do we want to see as the first steps?	1.0337594496163967
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level.	0.5147003789302516
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework, both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice.	0.9223640812677961
In Austria' s case, the statements are contradictory to say the least.	0.6409033861999893
Too little operational capacity upstream or, in fact, excessive use, can cause problems downstream.	0.7078524385816927
It is important not only for the environment but also for public health.	1.2461793072684686
This too is unacceptable in my view.	0.7644750212881022
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.	0.8730894418836557
- (PT) Mrs Korhola, as you will understand, I do not at the moment have the information I need to give you a concrete reply.	1.2148484997993334

We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available.	0.5762800452477781
The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment.	0.882593214248362
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.	1.111118817877972
However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis.	0.8325698417215657
But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag.	0.7394725453672851
Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime.	0.8721854773592667
Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism?	0.9923827600330646
But, if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly, then this undertaking was only a tentative one.	0.963079899573625
Instead, we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal, to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect.	0.7692277500492583
Like the whole of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have therefore voted against the proposal to amend Directive No 1 and have abstained from voting on the proposal to amend Directive No 2.	1.022519446368364
It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions!	0.506171812232904
Parliament cannot change these details.	0.42239457688512694

There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power.	0.5949788008999667
Indeed, we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective, in any case, the objective that I wish to achieve.	1.1443314161969391
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.	1.0288867217280875
It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues.	1.1731418775471893
This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate.	1.0611725276645667
In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing.	1.038450544881127
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.	0.5083657174796093
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House.	0.7345869657610697
At the moment, the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated.	0.8058554131057392

(The Minutes were approved)	0.16961969204465593
The fundamental problem is that, at the moment, the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group, but it is also true that they have no legal status. This is simply a political commitment.	1.0018738352288055
As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid.	1.0847093294866976
So I think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all.	0.7987744629552931
The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete.	0.6379380419661331
So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either.	0.8360898487039542
Firstly, the governments made a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the Treaties. This commitment was not fulfilled in the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding.	1.128970259141879
It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities.	0.9980620821935975
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market.	0.6870036844359816
All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica, the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece, despite the objections of the Greek people and, at the same time, intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia.	0.7128394863040882
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference.	1.186505631894001
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect.	0.6077086391590181
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points.	1.0040573121713985
The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so.	0.8954728968846424
Again, because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward, we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community.	0.9076942748869583
You must understand that a presidency' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited.	0.4662817672910714
We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled.	0.8943514126583091
The Member States have spent similar amounts.	0.9071183900916957
Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.	0.9747539678546249
In my grandparents' time, it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville.	0.7659875972303178
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers.	0.746421189779573
You still have not finished that agenda.	0.3934978368321231
Compare it with what happens in December.	0.6986212211212989
Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria, as in any other Member State.	1.0712845398399042
But there are some questions still outstanding.	0.8490515183122141
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point.	1.048341475005178
In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.	0.5349784495326004
I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget, and that is that the investiture of the Prodi Commission, last September, received wide support. In our opinion, this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe.	0.9110140690883928
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date.	0.7378568733194548
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	0.2809891078000158
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital.	0.9548037214518643
Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them.	1.233358970792371
First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies.	0.9206595830499437
I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo.	0.6277743891822984
The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences.	0.9228228866001051
How, furthermore, can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe.	0.7341504281507117
In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.	0.7651648479924218
It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures. This indicates how difficult these dossiers are.	0.9999446638690621
These discussions essentially cover four areas: security, the structure of government, territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation, as a result of the situation following the partition of the island.	0.8525600534782841
This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal.	1.0028927233595142
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree.	0.7930075576127882
Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrón i Cusí shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe.	1.0364919513519972
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.	0.9164545001092308
Beyond this, we have concerns that the "flexibility" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present.	0.8619904281981549
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this.	0.4724528493801354
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country.	1.0012287077271043
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions.	1.0467324720437885
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers.	0.9850534503343997
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state.	0.6569707835044154
They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement.	0.7377892506963918
As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.	0.7740120871467598
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.	0.6294967994197427
Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody.	0.633563778600386
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?	0.8034426686444889
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone.	0.806488624871651
Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together.	1.1982436868623407
However, this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives.	1.0036806461412
Financial control' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.	0.7772008372715562
The Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, is not here yet, but I hope, and expect, that she will arrive in the next few minutes.	1.2457444381200211
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.	0.8923325443273983
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators, but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment, or to put it another way, projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs.	0.9740995864626115
We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question.	0.8691633960315372
In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States.	0.7803271474679403
This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice.	0.7749722319499712
We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future.	0.9635039481686319
I think Parliament often protests about this method, not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council, and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs, since, the truth is, it is something of a tradition, which the Council has kept going for a long time.	1.0243248576481574
We wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it.	0.738464892617559
The labour market and social protection are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, that require harmonised policies and rules.	1.070691200992226
It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that.	0.7733220003343249
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states, and Member States of the Union at that.	0.8050383205437212
This is an economic community, of course, but it is also, primarily, a community of values.	1.2229402447173847
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo.	1.122121930533311
People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment.	1.108252449602438
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.	0.7988990117778949
On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion.	0.726690236689306
The European Union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year.	0.682696843367587
I can only quote what is contained in the general Structural Funds Regulation which specifies that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States. It is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner.	1.2118955784249688
If we are to strengthen the European Union' s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action.	0.8849002065677373
To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading.	0.926184810135654
Having said that, the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions.	0.809896019431379
I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines.	0.7832409278068726
It would be very difficult for those who propose a 'yes' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission.	0.7811439603216744
Mr President, Commissioner, this is a very important directive.	1.1365680086848673
Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent.	1.1064364280119083
On the other hand, the Portuguese Presidency will continue, if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office, which is by no means guaranteed, to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened. It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just referred.	0.9373339372365727
We could not agree more with the latter.	0.5835473393624108
I hope everyone, like Mr Decourrière, whom I congratulate, will realise this!	0.976017596192372
That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved.	0.7583132788113304
If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates, we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them.	0.9897366000806448
Then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family, the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens' rights are only respected within sovereign states.	0.8509500514066516
The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening.	0.6483515937786405
With regard to Schengen, without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council, or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework, I would like to stress, on the topical subject of restoring border controls, that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority.	1.0338638539703924
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States?	0.9782989450918368
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.	0.7880289585598647
However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001, and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification.	1.2736492724009285
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor.	1.0868785132040029
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested.	0.7978287081575535
Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities.	1.3132485376057903
And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy.	1.309640538794674
Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as set by the Helsinki Council, i.e. focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe, must be adhered to.	0.8614747647582652
Attention must be paid in the LEADER+ programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result.	0.7921893467305263
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan.	0.7297298920842517
Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes.	1.1312514517088614
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.	0.5701265317961928
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship. We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects.	1.0212155132643648
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reformist and ambitious mood.	1.123339194551154
Subject: Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive, for non-consultant hospital doctors, who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN))?	0.7222333761878941
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care.	0.7553228940568985
We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies.	0.9960564306836981
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.	0.8455780901960951
We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one.	1.0747296595238685
One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.	0.8598221777063313
I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there, overall they were certainly positive.	0.833028474203191
This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation, and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould.	0.8673668519401723
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules.	0.590936622010437
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay.	0.7343806138638993
But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way.	0.867462125491267
Parliament' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old, in excess of 80% market share to a new environment with rigid, excessive copyright regulations.	0.8659031496382077
We are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation, that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments, and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone, but they are all countries which now know that, once they have overcome their difficulties, a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the European Union.	1.002886000072518
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East. It has taken fifty years to reach this point, which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations.	1.044865908166453
Mr President, Commissioner, whenever a serious social problem occurs, it always has a political basis. This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido.	0.8621798967649567
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city.	0.6918320512401804
In particular, we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether.	0.7852176015500871
Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans.	0.7600979112636215
These days, someone who lives in an old people' s home is accommodated within the social field.	0.7347220596837218
We are looking for solutions.	0.585406916259384
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question.	0.9758027004042235
I hope this signals a new era of hope for Cyprus.	0.6313202166751872
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad.	0.3739968817898626
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else.	0.6854336725391167
We must primarily ensure that the basic needs of the poorest people in the countries most affected by the AIDS disease are fully met. These countries include Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.	0.8363258961570653
I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state.	0.8908808133178332
Firstly, we need to make the EU' s development policy more effective.	0.9942693099979644
The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere;	0.9868863585395101
We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough, they have to suffer this type of aggression.	0.9341124382838207
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg.	0.817234600801219
In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules.	0.8046010191054849
There was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease "unnecessary" activities.	0.9986217513798225
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs.	0.7559709500618421
Accordingly, the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market, based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines.	0.8152780209869432
Mr President, international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross-border crime and crimes which are committed in one State, but the evidence for which is to be found in another.	0.9683145063807107
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.	0.9864375438621726
The debate is closed.	0.19167325824190162
Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	0.8562361167343764
Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe.	0.8824442244896827
In fact, the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy.	0.8863423373856327
What are the Council's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	0.7285521511911153
To this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff, including programmes for training the unemployed and their re-introduction to work.	0.7057275103760272
Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly.	0.9575337941887222
And this is the result.	1.3303243511847294
Like everybody in this House, I want freedom, justice and security. I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation, chaos and confusion.	1.103981619471696
With regard to the Judicial Network, significant progress has been made, in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Judicial Network, whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan.	0.9790788202323146
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading.	0.856235374051409
Mr President, when the Doñana disaster occurred, the non-governmental organisation, the World Wide Fund for Nature, gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in Europe.	1.1369504797556274
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.	0.8713264355743876
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public.	1.121362317555617
Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist.	1.1523579712126275
This is not impossible.	0.9761564870238282
This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic.	0.4455875642161161
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question!	0.8017835619327345
Effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels, thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-day life in real terms.	0.7355689012289811
If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead, you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have heard today, you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament.	1.2957892110355071
Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said.	1.103701878301519
Furthermore, the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity, when we consider their application in practice, that it appears simply impossible.	1.0959591375621347
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this.	0.7962730289995822
On the one hand, any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party.	0.6599028641521802
That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive.	1.2947327928496661
The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal.	1.0894144306262141
Since the end of the cold war, compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation.	0.7083165747269822
Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset, it should, in my view, demonstrate this in practice.	1.0624254720887563
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth, not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy.	0.8951071920161091
I dare say this because I took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from, among others, scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully.	0.680046003472101
However, I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation.	1.0718715039393338
It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now.	0.7280501371473607
From the point of view of economic growth, and therefore of increasing employment and wealth, safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor, and one that is certainly very important for our future.	1.2203871278358198
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project.	0.944993174788467
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.	1.223949547926539
I am sure that this study - if carried out objectively, with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible, not only in terms of its application, but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives.	1.0722474004434897
Madam President, in the phrase which reads 'Where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned' , the words 'under the national law of the requesting or requested Member State' should be added after 'Where' .	0.7304739445150118
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say, and I think that they are right, then to take up another six months of the Commission' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible.	1.0245768905829844
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today?	1.0068133040604206
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.	0.5565069061654035
By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant, and is therefore not a problem, from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, stifling the chances of any economic and social development, we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon.	0.9742549228330691
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes.	0.8805375050779167
First of all the report reveals Parliament' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly.	0.939080693913215
It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage.	0.8360417185871682
The Council, Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive.	0.8298636206751503
In this context, account ought to be taken of the smaller groups, and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements.	0.9435109362154359
Bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade, as highlighted by Mr Koch, does Commissioner Liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the Community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy, given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment?	1.039932770325838
Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission' s accountability for the future.	1.0136447480222568
- (DE) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU.	0.8891165194981498
Mr President, firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach.	0.9949934173068142
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.	0.8980360950894447
As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments.	0.8637130473403308
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here.	1.1647966625575221
As is known, the Commission should already, before the end of 1998, have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/67, guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service, securing its economic viability, and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved, including postal workers and customers.	1.0735898530553138
Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica.	0.8561821286505666
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing.	1.0018325195486744
It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe, with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts, as well as an issue which we seldom talk about; the North-South challenge.	1.0148682495314372
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.	1.077237992506271
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it.	0.9649375325387799
However, in the absence of these powers, it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure.	0.9449044730382405
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	0.8038918613580036
The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second.	1.040303003143498
This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal:	1.088050054958185
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.	0.7473106634648226
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union.	0.7858860291089395
I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships.	1.0633569156642328
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.	0.780325959045196
I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative.	0.9178869879596797
My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft.	0.6759373888676264
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as, as a result of this, the card' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States.	0.751393729157764
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.	0.6775914324278861
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society.	0.7630168448031962
We are therefore faced with two options. We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process.	0.9837199525939315
I have given you my answer.	0.5796649360599037
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate.	0.6733115206762822
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria.	0.806052008129269
These journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime, for which they are being persecuted.	0.8987016664282492
Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper.	0.9551105591232187
Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter' s content.	0.8161751245481371
Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions.	1.1245146360701925
I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate.	1.21848267912376
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission.	0.7824416493788285
This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union.	0.7190247777701585
Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8272796881033756
Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen.	0.9625304652175939
Rapid action is called for!	0.25405709298951223
This is something you already know, but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening.	1.0639740677923328
Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life.	0.9460790258655123
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides - Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged.	1.1168010181673322
Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned.	1.0314153640741266
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision?	0.727054250744872
Article 177 specifies these objectives as "sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them" , the "smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries" .	1.0073504491931102
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account.	1.431383068708334
This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system.	0.4966361989969108
A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time.	0.6922607483625561
The Council therefore expressed its satisfaction, in its December conclusions, at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission, which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal, together with similar contributions made by Member States.	1.004081643709278
I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure.	0.9690626060613103
Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed, particularly, and most seriously, by companies which are making huge profits.	1.0083634982689325
Mr President, during the most recent meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was pleasantly surprised.	0.9692156251755558
Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative.	0.8823870649483898
Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage.	0.8871331727713132
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.	0.5820753959855411
The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined.	0.6963236014841692
I appreciate that it is a provocative question.	0.8514335612457521
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair.	0.8652606965772579
Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business.	0.9563564628263646
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	0.5839313246259971
Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation.	0.7047217601760579
We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers.	0.6526907304058054
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion.	0.7481441687000152
It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital?	1.0316941391067385
I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection.	1.1015799040010752
In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar, a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar.	0.676323330059683
I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today!	0.6760000699200907
Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you.	0.7899468989879175
We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020.	0.673290936378433
I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45.	0.4453946840362291
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind.	1.2438972426862054
The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions, rightful claimants, revenue or benefits, etc. It is thus impossible to bring all States into line.	0.7045646882638849
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate.	0.6047622126578436
However, we must be realistic.	1.235353763447467
It seems to me that the only people in Malta that want this are the political class, and I shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the Maltese people are the winners.	0.9863700690352146
Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed.	0.4301173952733929
Question Time (Council)	0.4136614531061068
The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President' s cabinet.	0.4376660407618157
My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible.	1.1911645999436116
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government.	0.9433226460218662
In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia.	0.8394253463350438
Madam President, many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission' s statement.	0.9678396392867098
The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning.	0.7890742753403039
However, the Council statement gave me hope for the future.	1.076923433995515
This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the Exxon Valdez disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.	1.0376031932269407
Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that.	0.7529813077629147
Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, the 1999 harvest of decisions was indeed rich, so much so that it became difficult to gather, i.e. to put those decisions into practice.	0.7948558882233442
The plant is not yet there.	0.6968148645688169
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny.	1.0399479747431328
With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union.	0.8725589247528237
However, I find these passports inadequate.	1.017407372753588
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)	0.3218728569697865
I welcome Mr Barnier' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced.	1.1231360697898547
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union' s being able to function come what may.	0.8624355885561084
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .	0.7774546020985688
The end of this artificial separation of Europe marked the start of a new era.	0.9816445475037214
I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed.	0.9419638272194846
The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners.	0.7543994821956143
It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present, which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgios Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem.	0.8714593553664698
My concern is, if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC, whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8349291869535984
One of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions.	0.8103717172837449
Fifthly and finally, the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated in accordance with the 1995 European System of Accounts' definitions.	0.5684782331840746
I also welcome the Commission's communication.	0.9937016634383812
I am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss.	0.6706105681021899
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.	1.0988467375701811
The joint debate is closed.	0.5467061562285509
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives.	1.0894258820191518
The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world.	1.1053050629016155
The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004).	0.9680921966440881
Furthermore, future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States, for example the food safety authority in Ireland.	0.8165933479223134
As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.	1.1523584184959486
In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems, we need a policy of general wage increase, the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State.	1.18661722942816
This has, from the outset, been the position of the Portuguese Presidency.	0.8723252186655894
It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding.	0.864002998737709
Finally, the issue of officials.	0.9533337589851288
It will be there for some time to come.	1.0074327061023236
Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment.	0.8663254823900925
I do not use those as an excuse.	0.7028393796242977
ALTENER	-0.0
I cannot think of a better way to do it.	0.8622097751938426
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose.	0.6766362873626643
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.	0.8528572652699736
Lastly, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes, what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.	1.0604594712012132
In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services.	1.0556910833148079
He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000.	0.9115450905129948
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence.	0.7088804023382147
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January, if the programme is presented before 30 April.	0.976295490065662
On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself.	1.2804388765809653
We need, therefore, to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives, to address, not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy, the apathy which you identify.	1.0533076329439806
The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime" .	1.11257167519031
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means.	0.4847984897638067
We should, above all, not lose sight of this. The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact, especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential, but is also relying on support from the programme, mainly from a language point of view.	0.9892098715836238
Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo.	0.991199031566306

In my opinion, Burma should be put back on the agenda, too, certainly in the wake of Indonesia' s U-turn.	0.7085686702994592
The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	1.1906290090827625
We therefore support Mrs Lienemann' s amendment which observes that the allocation for LIFE was not increased when the Union was last enlarged, without even mentioning the next batch of new arrivals.	0.5822451520096755

If further regulation is needed, we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive.	0.9732677321175621
This is the problem, and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the Council, which is one we find completely unsatisfactory.	1.1686286441370712

What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function.	1.0308699038542117

In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting.	1.0874847973470192

To conclude, Mr President, allow me to remind the House that the directive needs a makeover which will make UCITS even more attractive, but it does not need to be strapped into a European corset which will squeeze the life out of it.	0.9625144352265508

Mr President, my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue, which has a feeling of déjà vu about it when you are my age, in any case.	0.9520842152710032
At the same time, the European Parliament created a new heading: 'pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean countries' (B7-04), under which two new articles were created for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pending the Commission' s presentation, following the Helsinki European Council, of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the Financial Perspectives.	0.8536721300459513

Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting.	1.1114770923008543

As I say, our amendments concern transparency, and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful, specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.	1.005005290314922
Mrs Karamanou, I recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this field have not been enough.	1.344871685747522
The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily.	1.1157234793723267

In her question Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals. The reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product, while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider, and on prospectuses for UCITS.	1.1586870509222975
My second question concerns the following matter. Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters.	0.6704103622713872

On this subject, any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women: to enjoy equal access to scientific study, to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence, and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly, enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career.	0.9784538304906911
Commissioner Barnier, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe.	1.0507107684219403
This is a big task but it can be done.	1.0996246749899137

That is a basic principle which we must uphold.	1.1625649391448416
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament.	1.114301880766022
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC. I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States, large and small, as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened.	1.0451062235516115

A very important proposal indeed.	0.8072441212831245

Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up.	1.1370277595806388

Finally, and I think this is important: why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent UN study explaining that, if Spain wishes to preserve its work, retirement and pension potential, it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050?	0.9044663423143817
Mr Marinos, we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency, and therefore, the cultural dimension is, I am sure you will appreciate, one of our main concerns.	1.2616425994805796
It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law, Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and killed him in cold blood. Now, just a few days ago, in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco, it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez, of the Basque police force.	0.8485954225414083
This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective.	0.8337896697486459
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn.	0.6253713393982747
Mr President, I want to say that I share the other rapporteurs' delight at the fact that better opportunities are now to be glimpsed for making further progress in Cyprus in the light of the improvement in relations between Turkey and the EU and between Turkey and Greece.	0.9137050494112047
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.	0.6646177712352074
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production.	0.5840200991020699
Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union.	0.9731845468488436
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs. They have more involvement in the problems and, furthermore, they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy, and thereby achieve better results.	0.9536420777491952
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III.	1.0272015127870675
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission.	0.4503419752418131
There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years.	0.8866421008545623
Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks.	0.7817762260542481
What sort of impression will an interested public, as well as the rest of the world, have of this five-year programme?	0.7352890030436752
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you?	0.930775787981011
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees.	0.6452708115858414
How are we going to assess the results of these five years?	0.798833872792142
The victims are waiting outside.	0.33811018700002304
I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but, for the rest, nothing will get done.	0.9992080902026526
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999.	0.9903955411682278
I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.	0.9273342523710536
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests.	0.5098017541158493
There were women everywhere.	0.32827501617045646
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs.	0.8306177967075097
Remember too, some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years.	0.8639495374367361
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	0.13310760738329844
There is time.	0.2055556676636832
But that is his strategy, he instigated this war.	0.8037861994494915
Madam President, my apologies, I was looking at Amendment No 36, which logically precedes Amendment No 37.	1.0929153214639828
The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro.	0.9705623955491319
It is before Parliament for second reading.	0.4800290501730742
Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts.	1.0857675068258459
For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee.	0.8059113883284528
This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy. Instead, it is an extension to the EU' s EMU project, which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship, namely Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark.	1.0306162041171447
The aspirations are fine, President Prodi, we want those aspirations to be matched by action.	0.8993896852509509
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar.	0.6576678614563383
In terms of human rights, Europe has a very eventful past and this is why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human rights.	1.0210193989784824
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.	1.000206598694727
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public.	1.0811554218719392
Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes.	1.1841810886460478
But we shall have a decision very soon.	0.8897674759918057
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years.	0.6972594251183337
The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds.	0.7437438234076139
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena.	0.9178982470982049
Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders.	0.9366953070856976
The Commission would have abolished URBAN, but this time Parliament drew the longer straw.	1.0307445885648354
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues.	0.767735189795713
We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution. Quite the contrary, it would be a solution leading to calamity.	0.7507824435383409
The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different.	0.6231005769033249
Although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has not yet started, the Commission has already developed the new instrument, entitled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.	0.9113751989205556
We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme.	1.1069837821442392
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.	1.0330573709228286
We Socialists reject the liberals' naïve optimism on this point.	0.4573350501054879
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.	1.0106836857463124
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.	0.98751786074892
As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure.	0.8486220186049032
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.	0.7643631379045299
Thirdly: it will need to be made clear for each of the EU institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the European Union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails.	1.189222714478791
I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia.	0.598786830261646
Cambodia	-0.0
There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s.	0.8040390642286211
Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences.	1.0110190812328217
It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for.	0.4612068012868004
The first is about the fight against poverty, which I think is becoming an embarrassment both for the EU and the Member States.	1.2909249586607285
And do you know why?	0.5010138482532362
Secondly, the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties, specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union.	0.7648981817619054
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis.	0.786289055554408
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended.	1.0554775989918244
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.	0.7136661529946706
Minister, Commissioner, everything you have just said has been very well expressed, even if a few male colleagues, if there are still any in the Chamber, perhaps gnashed their teeth.	1.0328252522225043
If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed.	1.1157094364601998
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern.	1.0899360678391918
What has been done about training?	0.9814392011276727
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	0.11404639962296499
As far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15% is concerned, I would like to stress that, apart from the fact that this limit is too low, the text does not define the concept of a group. This concept does not exist under European law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice.	1.051400905392256
The issue of universal service was mentioned by Mrs Isler Béguin, by Mr Miller, whom I thank for his personal message, and by many others.	1.0433910497971173
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through.	0.6125096035337547
Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently.	0.9875446308994484
The money from this pool, system, or however you want to picture it, would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder.	0.8070641238654661
Over 80 measures are envisaged.	0.29246852822485536
Now, as regards the Brok report, Cyprus and Malta are the last of the Mediterranean islands, and, unless I am mistaken, the last islands anywhere in Europe which have not acceded to the European Union.	1.0296610157072135
The question which I therefore ask myself is this: has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area, how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence?	0.9111333568922658
Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action.	0.7906192732633514
The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens: this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme, albeit with a scarcity of funds, can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal.	1.072341839061691
Well, patently, if we do open this debate today, Madam President, as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting, on the basis of Rule 50, we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments, enabling some other majority in this Parliament, at some future time, to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free, regular, peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State.	0.8866490266852384
As Mrs Randzio-Plath said, we must remember that the reason why certain Members want to revive this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic, social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries.	1.0038557295576633
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible.	1.0440632921441195
A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House.	0.7963133625603982
Mr President, the common position is sound, but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles.	1.098024162286028
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions.	0.7770310205097203
Now, the Union can certainly call the body an 'action force' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men, weapons and logistics.	1.0535163017759397
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.	1.2475625283548584
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers.	0.7991663068808071
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	0.7239399740990449
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme.	0.7394164785956887
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.	0.657293055336503
Please rise, then, for this minute' s silence.	1.0881852369044178
In my view, instead of "weitergeführt werden müssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben müssen" .	0.5944052625075118
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies.	1.170680533950585
My Group assumes that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required.	0.7537700537253085
Mr President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not purely a dark cave, politically speaking.	0.7736763108929394
Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.	1.0058434683942712
Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.	1.0483967021378917
The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent, provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically, so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained.	0.6734587855040679
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.	1.1390549153600917
I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote.	0.9862228072471249
We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe.	1.073458839759137
The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated.	0.40560288182039417
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union' s common foreign and security policy.	0.7681824997645084
I am opposed to this, unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group, because I believe that, in competition policy terms, the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met, and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation.	1.01056294572627
This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related.	0.79446923094207
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water.	0.7107658522949588
We know that there are other topics: for example, many Members have subscribed, along with us, to the issue of the seat of the institutions, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level.	0.9937333947048093
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement.	0.8335316548550711
It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult.	1.1861988458223964
If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" .	0.9803791051657753
If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority.	1.1483099272832664
I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool.	0.8552656962481061
If the current draft is correct, then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today.	0.8949683719557469
An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People' s Party has been advocating for some time.	0.8297692572879912
My apologies once again for my mistake.	0.3900173097230777
It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means towards improving services.	0.8307046230470863
They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells, they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools.	0.5942160826800625
In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue.	0.5704357709973091
In particular, there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty.	0.8206539509492223
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low.	0.36533933484187847
I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life.	0.7366881379267528
The European Commission' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term "foolhardy," and this is not allowed.	1.2144825121771516
Since, on account of the college system, discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or, alternatively, denied or postponed, it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged, crop up again as Members of this body.	0.927333497685302
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.	0.7384185299168101
Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis.	0.8618519366132644
In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars.	0.9110814981302653
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or, I could say, a single god of money at work instead of people at work.	0.9252112223233466
In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question.	0.7404726171119375
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):	0.24075242256667662
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.5812996053853545
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy, a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction.	0.845927057429365
I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place, because I lack the legal basis for doing so.	0.9678009829283423
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres.	0.5511536179335503
Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences.	0.9055573592696441
Who will be next, quite literally, for the chop?	1.0509786789226807
A European charter of fundamental rights would be the only ray of light in this policy but, yet again, there is no provision for the people of Europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically.	0.9660174030325303
So what is the European Union doing about it?	0.8596827941989053
In its 1998 policy paper, Agenda 2000, the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based: the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas.	0.8887594963985419
However, some people in our political group think otherwise.	0.9517183585522846
It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures.	1.1425726248912762
This would mean that the EU would unjustly be removing tasks from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily.	0.7660763132509825
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.	1.036843386388862
However, it must be "europeanised" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.	0.8808269758349911
Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed.	0.49383951336832244
With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way.	0.8097491162613769
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.22344901779118886
I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration, underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside.	0.7015749864328483
We could, as the Commission has proposed, accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further. Yet if we do, we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public, but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again.	1.2853770985474682
Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a shop.	0.6696364958043715
While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun, I think it is important to keep the two processes apart.	1.02371224385249
The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention, for the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment.	0.7852928431312985
Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.	1.1502587504541797
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, during the Asian crisis in 1997, as with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EMS in 1993, everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation, particularly currency speculation.	0.8773313666342795
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level.	1.003142970353083
Moreover, I shall only highlight the most important ones.	1.179669767314827
We think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, for the following reasons.	0.7917705804618863
I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo.	0.9028102333598774
We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies.	0.7646294951144763
This kind of tourism, which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens, is just as important.	0.9436148709881023
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February, the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.	0.8499369587244668
A simple reading of chapter 4, article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder.	0.8583315398721647
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for LEADER+ will again be presented to the STAR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 November.	0.8840704314929629
If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?'	1.0527886473157877
The Community construction only makes sense if it creates positive discriminations alone, and the UEN Group hopes that this signal to FYROM and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully-paid up part of Europe.	0.9230290623429747
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration.	0.9011598440415316

Following Nassau, a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place.	0.6119687491578572

Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new?	0.7675382431473677
The most remote regions, still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates, offer one example of this.	0.7513557741581683
I urge you to look seriously at this problem.	0.5350796910112205
It seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity.	0.5638764468468306
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so.	1.0577707021581675
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer.	0.8848543329324132
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.	0.9110162743618873
Can you tell us your position on this subject?	0.8963656319529694
In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament.	0.7922713701890157

This House has only prepared one report on this Convention. It was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the Council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed.	1.0784723075420222
There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field.	1.1186333036315337
That means, making a European bugging system like the transatlantic spying operation 'Echelon' perfectly legal.	0.4865186906369427

Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely.	0.8127604957120416
Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union.	0.9750231356811996
Of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action, and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mentioned two issues apart from Geneva which represent actions, one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about EUR 100 million that is spent through programmes, for which I am responsible, mainly going to non-governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation.	1.1969567418736986
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased.	1.0966950000194549

Mr President, Commissioner, my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive.	0.8692990221905682
I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance.	0.9095100169347444
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments, the donors have made commitments and, obviously, we are the only ones actually paying.	1.2646728227028192
We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions.	0.39900640896227574
In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields.	0.9355520487287947

Although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals, including some that we put forward ourselves, we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection.	1.05312198535343
My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance.	0.6293173238763294
This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties.	1.0672166900602926
. I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate.	0.9546093817109549
I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve.	0.9483297969879185
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right.	1.1472350767538566
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals.	1.043636544321457
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.	0.9300769867375602
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level.	1.0275107716916851
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem.	1.10635691523592
My first question, Mr Solana, will be simple and more direct, perhaps, than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me.	0.8620488217921871
Here in the European Parliament, as in many other institutions, we have watched this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened. This is because we felt the problem to be ours, as it was.	1.1133943356541205
Report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission recommendation on a Council decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 - 1999/2121(COS))	0.7214770655373711

In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets.	0.8089326069118941
One is knowing how the committees operate, about their composition, agendas, descriptions, and so on, and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions.	1.075734215745882
These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas.	0.5328828286419489
The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there.	0.4975764165889932
Employment: for many years now, the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality, and yet, despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless, the same recipe is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment.	1.104898763939875
Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it.	1.1705196178127744
However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general.	1.136479073199196
In this respect, I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation.	0.7932538896406548
So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think.	1.0776285364404026
However, I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER+ initiative.	1.1293760423321486
We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall, Madam President, that at the beginning of the last session, I raised with you the question of whether, in the interests of openness and transparency, the Members' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet.	1.0347027576622494
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly.	0.569486798106374
In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: "In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British?	0.8556389454978838
I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points.	1.0086307160133425
Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.	1.0470400948394576
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men' s report should be implemented.	0.7070046884283013
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions.	0.8768810269354395
Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction.	0.7288636167829405
An important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment.	0.8141480715442444
You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber.	0.9488375543231751
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result.	0.6707732013228316
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions.	1.2822891034543868
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.	1.0049983414695292
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming!	0.7594313529577945
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15%, 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term.	0.795071425200748
It will not do to keep us under constant pressure.	0.6778584277896398
To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.	0.8556851390898279
That surely is in everyone' s interests.	0.4555795915983661
If these, which technically speaking are copies, were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason.	0.7804211688073698
High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force.	1.0228748750681989
We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility.	0.8232785190988037
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions.	1.005089392356219
Question No 6 by (H-0122/00):	0.37407424121709665
We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions.	1.1527625586483636
We understand the context of this essential debate.	0.5757825528065266
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche.	1.2060894926345802
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether.	0.9727984460404024
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy.	1.1438606848556165
In this connection, French speakers would speak of a "coup de chapeau" : in other words, I take my hat off to the EU.	0.7736529679613806
What are the Commission's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	0.7666400577379124
But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy.	1.1839993887932898
I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations.	0.7565437452917843
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option.	1.0060485403840151
For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance.	0.9975532874034775
This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations.	0.7676309330056701
Quotas are not, therefore, the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility, just one of many.	0.9896831246436616
So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms, namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other, define the limits.	0.9744279407230936
GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty, both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health.	0.8300569575477439
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code" , the "European Public Prosecutor" or a European police force, with OLAF.	1.1098426864629811
The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.	0.7790451277532169
The availability of unskilled, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the Community.	0.8549314727773466
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter, in any circumstances, the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin.	1.0946333296849753
Naturally I completely endorse what they have said.	0.4905662548083271
I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity.	1.0718851875756075
However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms.	0.7029283579718968
In order to generate extra means if necessary, I think it is entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investors.	0.9656312305660404
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC.	0.9122122132241326
It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one.	0.8918411432279721
On the other hand, we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the European Union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged. This would not, let me make this quite clear, imply any kind of formal recognition.	1.1187225785875239
We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just underlined and, in some cases, usefully clarified.	0.9170778589454983
This needs to be said!	0.6211938034296194
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established.	0.9118029521837354
Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.	0.9365794165811171
Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union.	0.6584991785341995
As far as the citizens are concerned, it is what a regulation can do for them that matters.	0.9255504131396138
They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto.	0.885352769422013
This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies.	0.9126562883544173
Secondly, an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like European company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal.	0.8760296402877422
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision, establishing this element of conditionality.	1.0336212510774558
I say quite emphatically, even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is completely involved in the whole idea, that animal feeding, animal rearing, animal production must be suited to the species and must also, above all, cause no harm or danger to human beings.	0.8293335190350569
Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities.	0.3401634270210894
All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services.	0.8980359027391516
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever.	1.149207827076099
We must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism, so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age.	0.833934445300832
Report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999)0158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD))	0.6043005078914576
Question No 43 by (H-0045/00):	0.34811806097947906
However, for the economic sector which I represent, i.e. fisheries, this means change.	1.0897672434352539
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.	0.37875200056112407
We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.	0.6913344884760736
What do we expect from a government in any case?	0.7682660213176185
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future.	0.7671573214599463
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?	0.9829792738701839
The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.	0.6713058477666581
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.	0.8964686996650357
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate.	1.0036470345754476
Some of them are our ACP partners.	0.8069621553966396
However, I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the Member States.	0.954132542472965
I naturally hope that the result of today' s vote will be a good one.	1.0461942795822612
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe.	1.0197347535697843
I have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform.	0.8948616694287765
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be.	1.0523673051504225
Mr President, it is pleasing that, despite certain delays and problems, the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria.	0.9627548923530239
Moreover - and Mr Miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round, even in my country, however densely populated it may be.	1.1817880988800487
I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs.	0.846687953043288
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.	0.6491182481577505
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed, certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000.	0.8146741358824825
And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?	0.7751941056059294
Consequently, neither the Council, the Commission nor the European Parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State.	1.2104614846234516
I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe?	0.9868347441603851
This is undeniable, even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner' s control, have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be.	1.0261197056986882
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors, with the possibility, following negotiation, of increasing it to 54 hours.	0.8150456338143184
We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion, and frankly, we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine' s day, the first day of the Strasbourg part-session.	0.9608333035509798

Now to my fourth point regarding the policy; enlargement of the Union, the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, the major challenge, too, for the European policy on cohesion, a point which Mr van Dam highlighted.	1.1385289850035303

Madam President, my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the Commission' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate, instead of being reduced to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary.	0.8935111096779776
And yet, in the chapter on aid and training for refugees, the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to "refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention" .	0.7361896805919916
(DA) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution, but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect.	0.8832106505544581

Does it reflect this vision of coherence?	0.31154393344563697
What is needed from the European Commission, the Council and everyone else, is a quiet determination, a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both Cyprus and Malta without guile, granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession, so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about.	1.0600769851693095

We would warn against that trend. We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character.	0.8315646029074297
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.	0.9322891784638759
The proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht, raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 European system of accounts, which, as you know, replaced the previous System of Accounts adopted in 1979, and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories, consistency in the calculation of the ratios of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of ESA 95 and, finally, recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology.	0.7412268869284161

I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty.	1.1523788618979232

In view of this situation, renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, to create a tax on currency transactions. The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments, but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation, thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions.	0.9403103337164458

It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already.

However, the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation, that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that, where possible, Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure.	0.9460238921386999

Finally, I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour.	0.9401904398715892
Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market, and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests.	1.1773716297596761
Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.	1.1112466282963174

So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans. I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans, who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans.	1.0212763585632139
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament, you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague Fernando Gomes.	1.0725471256093795
. (NL) Mr President, could I first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has principal authority, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposals.	0.8618119926304701

The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward, concerning for example, the emphasis on access to start-up capital, how to exploit new business opportunities in cities, towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business.	0.8212903559927603
This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.	0.8595327584095935
It is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit, which intends to find out how we can put economic growth, employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society.	1.0167745109776996

Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks.	1.192099302984703
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.	1.015361206142485
I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo.	0.7184500969248426

Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg.	0.9302069093417449
Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form.	1.113453591383754
We will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case.	1.2003542013898243
Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits.	0.9398689867704921
That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken.	0.9017703854245086
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone. In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves.	1.1647639274703376
In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring.	1.1912648828065193
This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence.	0.9433398236537593
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings?	0.7247888477690041
It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example.	0.9322106886924388
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.	0.6965795800156873
All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.	0.7956340529955005
The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue.	1.0188812103626819
What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major, high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy.	0.6396461242205677
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that, as a general rule, the European Parliament will adopt its resolution, stating its reasons, at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure.	0.9746417325209923
Due to the existence of these borders, they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong. This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy.	0.9339353783922847
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.	0.993964642113421

Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.	1.088302782420433
In my opinion, it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law.	0.7286709570132717

You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war.	0.8991965207912342
As for the future, given that the Commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in Austria, I am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of administering a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the Union.	1.068338566300409
How will BSE status in fact be defined then?	0.6433430747611216

This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity.	0.8383812889149056

To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.	0.9765834971447029
The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme.	0.9554624032340804
In 1988, the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men.	1.0326194032813278
Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character.	1.2232737713009834
Mr President, the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters.	0.9009991537882096
URBAN is designed to find solutions to urban decay, and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners' Party.	0.9589031529188312
To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks.	0.730584007943924
We can therefore table only one additional item.	0.5802560830722442
The objective is thus to achieve, as closely as possible, a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual: an objective which now specifically applies not only to the Member States, but also to the Union, which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom, justice and security.	0.945978875629379
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement.	0.8473537827383713
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said.	0.812814107039679
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication.	0.9963964499014646
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation.	0.9010948619388367
It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs, which is no way to set a shining example.	0.7354093589138705
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate.	0.8975870648895428
The programme which I shall present for the fifth women' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring.	0.6945297578479471
The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow.	0.8916984606591825
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate.	1.1121128957607747
Did anyone find work?	0.1251839600585309
Mr President, some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film, "Cocoon", in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again.	0.9258064921437958
We have already heard about the various aspects involved.	0.9266292526313298
How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?	0.9643519508839914
Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel' s proposal and wordings.	1.0372218394907788
In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values.	1.0358167015392092
Therefore, the Commission should address the issue once and for all.	1.2702683643535888
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives, it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable.	0.9210045016929304
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.	0.9123849440672375
We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers.	0.9170825904604196
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month.	1.0008819233564443
Finally, a compassionate thought for all the volunteers, nature lovers and bird lovers, who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds, organising rescue operation with the means available.	0.740992873318159
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests.	1.071801830442912
And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here.	0.8950702680556056
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0014/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	0.7133310838681768
Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.	0.9455532463226697
A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening.	1.0522568027480734
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing.	0.8656564420091238
For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago.	0.7753931905384
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises.	0.6857440553832607
- (PT) Mrs McKenna, a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission.	1.1107617394590465
Then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures.	0.7497426074620726
For us, it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use.	1.0496448925991078
And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the European Union, recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base, with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access, on equal terms, and in which our citizens can have real confidence.	1.0130788418332972
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.	0.8853545322466555
In spite of the fact that this Community initiative is aimed at rural development, it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way, and this is unacceptable.	1.0966465548332
For the sake of our credibility, we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world.	1.0149792383255503
If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we federalists are convinced, we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard.	1.0945986725812769
In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Albanians, we have stressed - and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population, the Romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable.	0.8286068011071999
This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements.	1.0316726705687116
It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account.	0.7606264286617227
Modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves.	0.8991982580402007
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming, with the social distress taking the form of unemployment, misery and crime.	0.873091541131786
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.	1.053567211550456
First, the form: the draft convention is vague in the extreme, and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society.	1.0428084842889647
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda.	0.4467270365591615
Unfortunately, however, it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions.	0.9243168369405973
So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.	0.9147270762128249
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage.	0.9007893201702248
The El Ejido incidents were shocking, as several Members have said in their speeches.	0.909069623722327
Investment in OTC derivatives, however, should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced.	0.6055797200469937
We have beef exported to southern Africa, to Namibia and South Africa, which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland, so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union.	0.71195455464358
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.	0.8570232450652238
But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory?	0.4261433341980104
I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.	0.9434376479285365
When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.	0.7676231898385654
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.	1.1147586356714698
We should recognise, however, that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results.	0.7172009778363044
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do.	0.853548490598407
I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.	0.8997392752076496
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.	0.7071100938612683
The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers.	1.1457434070550871
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day, but I suppose better late than never.	0.8131209767012091
It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended.	0.9238928974786204
Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference.	0.9327412626709128
The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree.	0.9637534414593337
My second question is about whether the Portuguese Presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue' s being solved in different ways for Members of different nationalities, or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities.	0.8642714580075139
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal, its former president, Mr Soares, and its government, maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans.	1.1299775068111428
You have, Mr Solana, heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo, Chechnya and elsewhere.	0.8178979630189214
By adopting these amendments, Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors.	0.6413536451738794
The Commission has no means of influence here.	0.9725657830451961
As Vaclav Havel rightly said today, the European Union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual.	0.9062328172849143
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.	0.68414922671249
As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it.	0.9538982244098885
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels.	0.8177296618534854
The most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in September 1999 and it relates to the 1998 financial year.	0.7889775935975822
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.	0.8642000027500232
In this context, let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency.	0.5550494796211135
That was the charm of LEADER, and that should please not be lost!	0.916971932660274
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.	0.7171266740007662
Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round.	1.047140922238622
If a civilian task force can, at the same time, intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step, we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers, but who are incapable of sending in civilians.	0.8010420106548648
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question.	0.9121154427576463
In fact, the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. The first is rural development, and let me say, Mrs Schroedter, that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport, an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time.	1.2628410096060332
The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers.	0.5601993363116795
However the Union should be seeking, beyond that, to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater.	0.9892133435942578
We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment.	1.1457164738688423
We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community.	0.9726013205650869
By persisting with their proposal of EUR 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004, and by refusing to accept the European Parliament' s proposal of EUR 850 million, the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced, and rightly so, for other measures in LIFE III.	1.0986176847684466
This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it.	1.0367620179307737
What, may I ask, is the Council afraid of?	1.0818449617465988
Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.	0.6392503617449476
The resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights.	0.7813672854362934
We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, extending into crucial new areas like financial services.	0.7371397139384792
This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union.	0.9281942717962255
The mudflat at Stregrennan, which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission, has been completely destroyed at this stage.	0.9130439205610059
I have already told you on a number of occasions that we, on behalf of the Dutch contingency, would like a Dutch television channel.	0.8410592715675186
This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union' s cultural policy activities once again.	0.5371116011463413
For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process.	1.3422148496324924
I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development.	0.9215685281734916
This is of great importance, especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market.	0.86996061117075
And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties?	0.9782290966996361
For our part, we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere, because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the Union' s image and to the Union' s own particular identity.	0.9201919412037863
Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic	0.4839056281781535
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration. I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group, but it is no coincidence that the European Council' s decision is supported by those who are, after all, in Parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration.	1.1082289128668368
Nevertheless, I have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition, which will evidently imply some concessions.	0.9289770350495361
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.3403058449226506
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense.	1.1292737326564657
Even today, we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics.	0.755990681232672
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive does indeed, as many speakers have already said, represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe.	0.8433754391868387
And, again, I urge you, Madam President, to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently.	1.0109554348957197
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.	0.3578677751376731
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997.	1.0055535370705624
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate, it is evident that it is an important one.	1.0429811817311738
Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically?	0.8327949504976981
Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee.	0.8778537236076024
Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting, we do not need another to add to those already available.	1.1202225537333383
After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals?	0.731598299455028
It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest.	0.7031031802531524
In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the "communitisation" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.	0.8925721698312103
The issue is as topical as it was before.	0.8901482704574939
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider' s electoral success.	0.8026036826366358
I have been working now in all industrial and service sectors, but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible.	0.9290534206440644
Finally, let me repeat, we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations.	0.9125576676528541
Thank you, Minister.	0.711460735280516
The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground.	0.9899946630546081
This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms.	0.6986437030422634
Therefore, Commissioner, we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation.	0.9966595352965757
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, on her very serious work.	1.0119847110514009
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.	0.6310906538492035
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives.	0.5913038923463981
I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us.	0.9519942925958772
In this connection, the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament.	0.9093437486119688
Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line, and I supported Amendments Nos 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group.	0.9001531168201842
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.	0.6108474674519071
Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, 'We cannot release him: he is a war criminal' .	1.0685284864163191
I hope to be able to set the process in motion then, although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter.	0.8290418476834345
These discussions have also recommenced more intensively in the relevant bodies of the Council, and I think that I can say, in a spirit of openness and greater flexibility, and because we all recognise the importance that this has, particularly for the general public, that drawing up this statute is a vital factor in ensuring both the dignity of the functions of Members of the European Parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public funds.	1.0719875020556455
The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too.	0.8164465870658772
What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth?	1.0652540571828026
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	0.5758150058133144
We have 1.27% of the Community' s GDP.	0.5949600548254718
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick.	0.8421115201951657
Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	0.6894171551573147
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty, very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets.	0.7260326491446234
These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission.	0.7382512107801915
So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development, and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations, as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle.	1.0134246640675861
We have high hopes for what you will achieve.	0.4151120005414099
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply.	0.8329882496693448
As to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years, I do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned, even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison, as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment.	0.9668084328032744
It is up to the European Parliament to protect vulnerable people.	1.0243128755623434
We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours.	0.9827387553440468
Thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect.	0.4651641869750589
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources.	0.8716970617902265
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria!	0.7284857219709968
It is high time that we reached an agreement.	0.5790030204463873
If need be, the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision, and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002.	1.0555407558505605
Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory?	0.8101015881654033
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday.	0.7420492411319841
It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well.	0.979632945820289
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker.	0.9701710293528965
For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that.	0.7518924346579583
I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning.	0.7860379170744083
This Convention will lead to gross abuses of people' s rights to privacy.	0.6715943323881814
Mr President, it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union, more so these days than there used to be.	0.9204012703683377
The key to solving the Cyprus problem is in the hands of the Turkish Government, which supports and encourages the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denktaº.	0.9452139589765589
These are the areas in which changes will be made.	0.9384991764721643
But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion.	1.055844788184994
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy.	0.6298999504576784
We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them.	0.8646054005793063
I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area.	0.9956044806482758
In view of the seriousness of such situations, we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field.	0.906332822900042
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996, the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks.	0.8533383219692369
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended.	0.9416279612791048
This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern.	0.9434216119981744
First of all, the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic.	0.9070453274444156
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail, except for the fact that a time limit had been decided.	0.9338548614201871
However, I do want to listen to all the points of view.	1.1976235574346752
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.518633223075073
This is all I can say.	0.8924780946888287
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes.	0.7828468295390305
Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly.	0.9596098417402612
I would repeat what Mr Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, educate and thereby effect real and lasting change.	0.8702031087285089
I refer to item 11 on the order of business.	0.5100866663594931
Mr President, quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation.	0.8278403212634741
Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive.	0.925243654859946
Furthermore, 90% of businesses active in tourism are small or medium-sized, the very enterprises which form the living cells of our social and economic tissue, which are called upon to tackle the new obstacles and respond positively to the challenges of this global development.	0.9014722006564101
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud.	0.6771015127841051
I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report.	0.95229292773205
The correct speculative approach, it seems to me, is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos, rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets.	0.8477542022915374
(ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as chairman of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, Mr Prodi, you are not making things easy for me at all.	0.9193609642960807
Needless to say, the directive also needs to be binding.	0.782518592570178
The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts.	0.8782435053014389
As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions.	0.8589856612494553
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars.	0.5352398022547935
If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee, we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation.	0.8454391123266711
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment.	0.8730607142786747
Finally, in discussing the question of the future application of tests, we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable.	1.024743169555696
Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process.	0.8202205109613706
My second point regarding the policy is as follows: the Structural Funds have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the convergence process.	0.976068522781057
One of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States. Another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled, and which would react if any of them were violated.	0.8533284173981401
So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent.	1.0902688822434212
And, to that end, I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation, or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity, particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security.	1.057578058953846
Mr President, my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster, affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment.	0.8516565653825467
We need stronger banking supervision.	0.36071513597434446
Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old.	0.7238799469898272
The most remote regions, particularly the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund, in turn, cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas.	0.9435153945073048
Nor is it a mere luxury.	0.5636835458542712
Furthermore, Europe has signed international conventions, in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments.	1.0637272558820092
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness.	0.4735848883651131
Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the day before yesterday, there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme, which I would ask you to comment on.	1.2564781662419657
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential.	0.7615109485991912
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute.	1.2664637429838632
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force.	0.8220793093332512
As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report.	0.6632766437281347
Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee?	0.7529202366199736
And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets.	0.8179496756086809
Secondly, the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way.	1.0437782309802177
Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved.	0.9038712212568962
It is therefore important that the manufacturer' s liability should be clear. This should not in any way be jeopardised.	1.269899977379448
The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are, of course, underpinned by a mantra of the kind which, in recent years, has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding, but pernicious.	0.9362117846285647
(Applause)	-0.0
Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.	0.9597175440672416
This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so: I myself share these concerns.	0.7791613252721644
Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women.	0.9570986062438795
We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights.	0.4707512442543685
They were treated like the worst criminals.	0.481730566007547
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Europe needs a strong Commission.	0.9694180758832412
The Fifteen need to start work right now, with all the members of the United Nations; we need, at long last, to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position.	1.01840969303396
Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test?	0.7793316000019378
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.	0.9721137615064053
Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking.	1.0207490001887316
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.	0.9542121486944422
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition.	0.8965151221157917
It must form the basis for our partners' political will.	0.8202777384156043
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth.	1.0131441948598106
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House.	0.6595613596933418
That is most certainly relevant.	0.41921792696793914
Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.	0.8424359434099794
The acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures.	0.4822475528462331
That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method.	1.1506880945452365
I do respect and agree with this procedure, as I also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone. However, for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals, political parties, including my own, and institutions.	0.9884982502040599
There are no boundaries for Community policies.	0.6193689806980889
Addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities' historical and cultural role.	0.8527966006626659
Question No 3 by (H-0027/00):	0.257733922154771
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session, so this is quite exciting for me, a little like first love, although that did last longer than two minutes.	1.1627716929464338
In my own country, more than 60 per cent of Swedes save with a variety of funds.	0.7083567800625222
The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course.	0.9442328115112241
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, real per capita income in the world' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries. In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher.	0.9382504391733233
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.	0.84323568854267
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received.	0.45468263672246234
I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22, paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason.	0.7716544370541578
I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way.	0.8100213692292919
This principle should not only guide the public sector, it should also guide the private sector, especially financial undertakings.	1.036722072348968
And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy, including ourselves at this level, could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well.	0.8260950499588351
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood' s remark.	0.3757682847066127
On the contrary.	0.7837288747043872
No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect.	0.6459968520495374
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.	0.9817927360474134
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future.	1.0145661791422338
Mr President, Commissioner Patten has our understanding.	1.0101911276292848
However, an environmental Europe cannot, in any circumstances, be built at different speeds, but must be built from a point of view of solidarity.	1.1658543419730827
When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household.	0.9390218434935658
Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.	1.0024447939071672
I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise.	0.9350528541891069
In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative.	0.9061992828128052
Perhaps we can discuss this later on.	0.42219365484134336
On the other hand, more pro-active attempts, such as OLAF, which is currently operating, have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights.	0.7986661015673759
Despite this, there are some amendments which the Commission cannot adopt: Amendment No 26, which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start; parts of Amendment No 27, especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted, the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision-taking of Member States concerning delegation is repealed; Amendment No 31 because the Commission is of the opinion that the application of Article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in UCITS.	0.9306422966947505
Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence.	0.9732531361358674
Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union.	0.7118775045124623
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making?	0.5173894647279935
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation.	0.6945751233888197
(Loud, sustained applause from the centre and from the right, protests from the left)	0.7650763384173406
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	0.5436906247720051
The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint.	0.6753857589927431
On Monday, just two days ago, in Sintra, a beautiful city very close to Lisbon, the Defence Ministers of the fifteen Member States met and took some important decisions towards implementing this Headline Goal defined in Helsinki.	0.8664058031815228
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.	0.9164688816885376
That is what we intend to do: the necessary measures and programmes are in place.	0.9901391909461911
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and, hence, a widened IGC agenda.	0.8536768687488216
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.	0.8698954820323275
Is this right and proper?	0.5316987225685218
But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is.	0.9677406556434851
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role.	0.8494774908895452
That is why, in my opinion, the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility.	0.9703996388399068
Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come.	1.200746193561809
Although this framework decision is a step in the right direction, it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards.	0.6905863762190135
In Europe, after the Amoco Cadiz, or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast, in 1976, or the Torrey Canyon, in the same year, or the many other cases there have been, we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995, particularly in the last few years.	1.2370861738671481
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B, especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy.	0.9084868189024649
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration.	0.8635388640808308
That concludes Question Time.	0.27741621043666764
A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence.	0.7048353770583957
Mr President, the Israeli author, Amos Oz, managed to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiating table between the Israelis and Syrians recently.	0.59624120278251
Neither is correct.	0.23690146017912092
Moreover, we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups.	0.970008914295523
Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists. I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.	0.8983814949871749
Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests	0.8016623339883531
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council.	1.198301144270636
We will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote.	0.8877137056735773
During the first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new 'pre-accession' heading (B7-0), proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, should not be limited to the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus.	0.9567590750918534
Nevertheless, I recommend that we start, in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate, and particularly the rapporteur' s speech, from her office, if that is where she still is.	1.1338961210065674
I come from a region, Galicia, which has suffered similar accidents in the past.	1.0088704095073564
Mr President, a couple of years ago, the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.	0.982027133422749
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.	0.8420811282813794
When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call "les pures et dures" : no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions.	0.8835086061402053
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion, but I digress.	0.8737253715729388
The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.	0.9469096364556457
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive!	0.6492787766280702
In order to fight poverty, entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights.	0.5870499935145344
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision.	0.638006193472044
Then there are the interests of the Member States, which, being on the receiving end, may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario.	0.9949573092409311
As regards funding, EUR 613 million is not enough. Even EUR 850 million is not enough.	0.735772500108758
In matters of the environment, investment and ambition come in a variety of forms, and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term.	0.7629941632741511
Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel.	0.8198039660045147
If one looks at petrol, for example, one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland, and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany.	0.7816478517966086
On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	1.0352140798089886
Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door.	0.6957285923417305
Possible future Member States ought to be involved in, and have an influence upon, the shaping of the EU of the future.	1.092615649166724
However, we already knew this.	1.1621637302191266
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account.	0.9478569664443123
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses, adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts.	0.8304324747232094
Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium.	0.6208301886347446
It underlines the fact that, in order to ensure sustainable urban development, an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis, namely the unemployed, immigrants, refugees, women and the socially excluded.	0.93796667032904
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union.	0.9027597608645286
It is an excellent report.	0.9115730799093661
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials.	0.50662735528561
Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too.	1.2098421920646678
In addition to the objectives it is working towards, the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries.	1.0490839756772727
We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency, which is clearly carrying out excellent work, and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions.	1.0636926786005703
We need to pinpoint, and draw up an inventory of, the problem areas for coherence.	0.9473568402156238
Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide.	1.040059569835797
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity.	1.1079834486742188
Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families, because man is not made for the law, but rather law is made for man.	1.0534301058028288
The question is: who prosecutes?	0.8014853560157232
As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment.	1.017293700576624
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it.	0.7117229061825934
Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents.	0.695424036112167
Alternatively, it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions, in order to move forward in another way.	1.0776197567170738
In this case, the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass.	0.6847235066498494
This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements.	0.6996697162233306
One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket' .	0.9802411088697554
Regardless of the many other concerns we may have, BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved.	0.8029437210313743
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.	0.5968512211569738
Mr President, it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions!	1.178410888324972
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.	0.9871825617398191
The two proposals form a coherent whole.	0.6791765936832617
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army.	1.0665192355862647
How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us?	0.8480915323309992
Mr Byrne, we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work.	1.0908460299271014
Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently in second reading in Parliament.	1.016862339820241
It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices. All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market.	0.9380667585838326
This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union.	1.2856638783953829
I think that he is correct in this regard.	1.019132642232968
All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality.	0.2915313474805175
It was none the worse for that, but perhaps I will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that I want to touch on.	0.983286425272809
Why should we add to them?	0.5533593000940679
According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.	1.0302303781083029
The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric, including infrastructure, public and private services and so on.	0.8219227806295828
Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a decisive part.	0.9590984953903154
The Court's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through.	1.120168610885709
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives.	0.9504077378691134
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative, our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II.	1.1641576224881927
In the current situation, we should say to the Russians "If you want money, if you want us to reduce your debts, you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia" .	1.1907345596265244
I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today.	1.055200419098708
It is indeed.	0.5139656711965509
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.	0.6878202248408384
It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with, which is to say cross-border issues.	1.0655763634293256
In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more.	0.6536996198250502
In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary.	0.9541418513774883
It makes it impossible for those same Member States, at the IGC, to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights.	0.9173787656058077
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission.	1.0136343893184858
It is best to wait for that debate which, I understand, will take place fairly soon.	1.2738358393808111
Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners.	0.7421311816559857
The Commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola.	0.6015933758500854
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important, that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme.	0.9654247220824398
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included.	0.6359365690585571
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this.	0.697062147778404
However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed.	1.1210775412890723
Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries.	0.906355156487682
In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.	1.0321825619459388
I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low.	0.8418374142341376
It is, in fact, something very positive.	0.8921038554263327
I am delighted to welcome a delegation of the Hong Kong Legislative Council to Parliament.	0.6014666979120004
However, I do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the OTC derivatives, and I also think that as a European Parliament it is our duty to inform and impress again and again on consumers - who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long-term security, and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings - that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection.	1.1574974378471086
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency, with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council.	0.7246142335079839
Mr President, Commissioner, Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union.	0.7335002098712412
Why do I say that culture is important?	0.7278601408826821
Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid, trade and finance.	0.6793211885714479
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation.	0.46749360373611576
And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility.	0.9557700706521296
We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner.	0.47463845418658074
It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables.	0.7782173211609219
As far as the budget is concerned, as already stated, URBAN is there to support and complement national policy.	0.9511369747170161
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.	0.8571654121655676
What kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars?	0.7472610756052309
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road.	0.6544513085022279
In the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system, I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve, that is, the translation of policy into legislation.	1.0611186226992697
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.	0.700874544760843
I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria, but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia.	1.071383418050471
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission.	0.7854677532784834
The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244.	1.0658807898538514
For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life.	1.1614391278307243
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought.	0.6324961916153504
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.	1.1363544810203834
In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances.	1.0652928544693725
It is now February and we are still waiting.	1.0634921992940027
In the current negotiations on this third Community support framework, I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected, with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations.	1.0642352106203976
We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system.	1.049811260139291
Macro-economic policy, employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together.	0.9802801351372687
Madam President, they say, where I come from, 'it' s three times for a Welshman' , and three times, as I think you will discover in the course of that debate, I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent, and on several occasions, a moving debate.	1.1746493634832054
Perhaps this is a little worrying.	1.0129870854898755
If the Union takes the initiative, this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world, including in the USA and Japan. A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people, their parliaments, their governments and their democratic institutions.	0.9908033289286332
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen, I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate.	0.7662633208718498
Moreover, this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November.	1.0444486225255867
We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined. It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy.	1.1078128769173603
This is the Commission' s own survey.	1.2180879011800376
The postal service is also the social service.	0.8679039164802084
At that time, bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident, the Council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it.	0.7989303667986247
Disparate actions are not effective.	0.269223537115561
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment.	0.5158448008854034
Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.	0.8990553061385811
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights.	0.3479003306727868
Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union.	1.2572201732891433
Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service.	1.001027069817088
The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.	1.0789900575027587
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission.	1.2699919193945792
New types of funds have been introduced in the various Member States which are not permitted to market their units in other Member States.	0.7664804767347166
It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now.	1.0171991729066685
The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter.	0.9948201137932425
There is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point, highlighted by Mrs Frassoni, given that we now have an automatic information system.	1.0199405290429993
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)	0.48150754721247024
State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.	1.0589974470281862
Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission, not believing itself to be equal to the task, wishes, or proposes to shed, for example, its powers to implement common policies, which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty.	0.9133173201681392
These have been the most important moments in the Council' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	0.9132030972444257
If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk. Take, for example, Germany' s defence savings.	0.8381185983551832
As has already been pointed out, in one month' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income.	0.7983325674880588
The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process.	0.4990234896380248
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives, but Parliament' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	1.3006910333099821
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about.	0.9368638463708532
The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter.	0.902740680297194
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs.	0.950811912247295
Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation?	0.7592914202949946
Secondly, we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position.	1.0202048099550205
That is why we need transparency.	0.9593005257606786
A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas.	1.0934660261541749
It would be appropriate, therefore, to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of Union citizens and the desirability, in both economic and social terms, of promoting the European tourist industry.	1.004995534629694
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.	0.6882547965617039
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements.	0.8643777093700911
I beg to move acceptance of this report.	0.5417055263082245
Mr President, the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution, in this ever controversial debate, which is the result of a broad consensus, seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes.	1.0818985946190474
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so.	1.129255554035737
But the country also - and especially - needs external stability.	0.9785752125395635
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy.	0.6660754425135547
We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.	0.7894256350699193
I welcome Mr Amadeus' statement this morning, which acknowledged the difficulties of non-budgetisation of the EDF, which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU' s emerging common foreign and security policy.	0.7898043801394947
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+, but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion.	1.0206513805654418
Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution.	0.8122511552836509
As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels, which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities.	0.7380760601353136
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views, I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe.	1.1447368408018068
It is a most important point and needs to be clarified, Mr President.	1.1044462011893699
We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature.	0.6470877810121316
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states.	0.511804077080681
You talk about greater transparency, but produce proposals which would lead to documents which, at present, are available for public inspection being locked away.	0.8851015767721697
(Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes)	0.6840873163408872
The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152.	0.8669151232519274
I wish we were closer to that.	0.3845784992694869
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament.	1.0460756999258303
This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved.	0.6069289761739655
This is all the more serious, if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission, Mr Prodi, has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy, which you are legally required to do in 2002.	1.1219551348650043
As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one.	0.795274931347019
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.	0.8297724410345666
It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country.	0.7635092192195251
That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union!	0.6755880829626514
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	-0.0
I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm, the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions.	0.96015279878778
It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal, Mr Byrne.	0.9244454069382443
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.	0.5804182652442332
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.	1.0915695887597405
There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree.	0.8564964221034639
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.	0.5158800293881695

We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality.	0.860238474445035
And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions.	1.0497094692362725
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.	0.7717466220382544
Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice?	1.1049086962291068
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because, as I was saying, it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities.	0.93192189723473
Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor.	0.8314918843847575
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust.	0.5942896478030191

Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	0.9389276436717076

There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case.	0.833126852916886
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152.	0.7965099281118989
In fact, this directive, like so many others addressing environmental issues, is not good.	1.1099495941060906
I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter.	0.5517956912836356
The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency.	1.148871604826552

Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.	0.7360445945976245

My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted.	1.1926585594837693

Three amendments can be partially approved, and one can be approved in principle.	0.9184746657892295
I have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the URBAN programme conditional upon certain guarantees, firstly on concentration - I am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or, in exceptional cases, 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding: we must keep to EUR 500 per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear, and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities.	1.0292970181127035
It is, meanwhile, very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on central matters of common interest, notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.	1.0549186441260905

I would like to explain our thinking here.	0.6604275671367998
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check, not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan, or others, until we get the international competition law we so badly need.	0.8340711843020786

Mr President, in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence, coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States.	1.0763752722721995
It is important for me to have a chance to answer it.	1.184781195393319

The first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs.	1.3011913356604219
Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem, taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future.	0.781895183657941
Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block.	0.9114430485631204

So much for the quality.	0.7644128442203701
As for the rest, if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - I think you spoke of a cooperative structure - I am ready and willing, on the basis of suggestions from MEPs - you will be acting within your role and I within mine - to relay these suggestions, provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the Structural Funds Regulation.	1.0846005058318127
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.	0.9415435027388099
Projects should also specifically address this problem.	0.411006030938478
What is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publishers are persecuted, as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appeal, in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd, arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout, the smug expression of straitjacketed thinking and intellectual conformism?	0.7542117522586244
Mrs Stenzel' s report has, however, turned out very well, at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned.	0.8540250577351993

This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria, and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens.	0.9538492518509757
I am sure that we will improve on that in the future when we have had a good high-level working group report, your support with your report here and also when the tourism sector is part of enterprise policy.	1.1175189084064752

Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.	1.2538598415995852
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.	1.032249310832781
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament, because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative.	1.0131894861043342
Human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world.	0.7528708080741187

Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000):	0.400379892168476
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled.	1.0387452121636642
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC?	0.7150133743885341
Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia?	0.784781408676254
I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that, because of the need for division of labour between the international donors, the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation.	0.860056700297196
The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come.	0.9625689195716954

The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.	0.9146543624782613
This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance.	0.9663495897530687
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.	0.6164969054742283
So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living.	0.6247807897132516
That is unacceptable in a democracy.	0.7142247704700534
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.	0.9093139722843571
Well, we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses, something we certainly do not want.	0.9306461290216007
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks.	0.9051931290300645
That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals.	0.9848528659411343
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.	1.080075739054461
So far, the promises which have been made are still, however, to be fulfilled, especially where transparency is concerned.	1.0339293006337749
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.	0.7598410365940385
As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis, with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future.	0.9391849353433475
I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will, I hope, address this situation.	0.9577249334162227

Mr President, in this important debate on competition, I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen' s document on the Steel Aid Code.	1.0826431711331783
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention.	1.1789215847125225
Of course, this cannot be done in one country; it cannot be done within the single currency area, but it could be done at international level with global cooperation.	1.1264336056050892
Unfortunately, the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.	0.9479321648727255
It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000.	1.013507071370768

Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and, in those circumstances, as scientists will have to travel, it is probably better that they move to a central location, once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based.	1.0243826356340622

All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería.	0.7632742854565108
However, they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the European Union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire.	1.13210539044986

Mr President, it cannot be repeated often enough: since 1975, the Lomé Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects.	0.8651882774275679
The tourism market is by definition a flexible market; we do not want this flexibility to be seen in a solely negative light, with seasonal work being misinterpreted as illegal work: remember that 50% of employment, especially in southern countries of the European Union, is done on the black economy.	0.8886492887286838
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki.	0.8062405442540301

We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic' s forces in Kosovo.	0.911754787245897
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading.	0.7109679598622494
We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem.	1.0315200453480788
Because of the situation in Austria, this is a dark day for Europe.	0.9905408934989691
Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator.	0.7371785418362801
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles (8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	0.6384204077307869
In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking.	1.1812716513175274
The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff.	0.9152791090138443
This proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain.	0.5749456353308782
Today, we have arrived at the end of a long road.	1.0836099271048265
Given Poland' s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing.	0.7733377435276384
Our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution, their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious.	0.778295071961372
Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently.	0.9525488216666635
(Applause)	-0.0
However, Mr Decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats.	0.6088851586836695
We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question.	0.8356939198119875
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France' s at 10%.	0.7621192542479791
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.	0.9685219838197756
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say, although of course he has no obligation to do so.	1.1311695902099645
Report (A5-0003/2000) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on	0.5066506195563133
LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot, pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States.	0.7394007568161771
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights, for that would be the enemy of freedom, justice and security.	0.9471524311065658
Most of the technical issues have been resolved.	0.5058842203727903
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development.	0.675993750034471
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact.	0.6983062311978496
To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace.	1.061232381139404
That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues.	0.7978465784921261
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.	0.6841024910622309
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.	1.1781854654099884
Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance.	1.0440356609112513
Firstly, let me make a statement of fact: the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union.	0.761059390940359
The answer, of course, is an emphatic no.	0.7816210018970856
Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is, I am afraid, just an excuse.	1.2525177822592883
Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.	0.7680143242949384
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II.	0.6136430491367534
The Commission does not have enough staff.	0.742695939038438
Absolutely, I do not think that will pose a problem.	0.907561946147635
The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR.	0.9087003823554933
Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example.	1.0258272162873903
B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain);	0.6027189670223388
I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today.	0.8664857741769446
We should remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all a minority within Europe.	1.0445060944383413
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers.	0.7525440165163512
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato' s report.	0.6246637951015628
Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia?	0.6722727001648564
It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese, the Chinese leadership, is Communist first and Chinese second.	0.9809921141604616
The committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the Commission' s proposal more stringent.	0.9852433848556704
Nonetheless, if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas, within the scope of this initiative, remains available, then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas.	1.1887730264498308
Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.	0.8215005393951718
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.	1.0446346421229855
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs.	0.6831494810946442
To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change.	0.7517406329923215
I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President.	0.6669889209282802
Firstly, the enlargement of the thematic areas.	0.9053234667066834
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities.	0.925598092771602
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.	0.8220999600337549
You will agree, furthermore, that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction, and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up.	0.8869798717136868
Mr President, we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta.	0.7562086253331577
It is clear that, for once, the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations, and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967, while the Israelis wish, since they consider that it suits their situation better, to have the borders which were set in 1923.	0.9249135522053241
Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators.	1.0690661854321035
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.	0.5855047355573092
I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe.	0.94196942660593
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities.	1.2082933491797465
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do.	0.6037177398333081
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry.	0.9425560858142615
Above all, however, we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us.	1.1288926842615703
Madam President, the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever.	0.8749933981637174
Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world.	0.8087919176781029
That is absolutely absurd.	0.5318561115160275
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised.	0.4734023807413974
However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible.	1.2004312055794988
It would be appropriate, however, for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conferences.	0.9686544583412892
We do not want financial control to be abolished.	0.8550483399115782
Finally, the Commission welcomes the resolution which continues the line of the high-level group, the Commission communication on enhancing tourism' s potential for employment and the corresponding Council conclusions.	1.0161019069133455
With regard to your suggestion for increasing the Court' s resources, the Council considers that all of the Union' s institutions have, under the Community budget, the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective remits.	1.1083620532578342
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives.	0.7367330128746397
Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition.	1.1657157581540476
We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President.	0.6685624522220696
In our report, we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area.	1.1055699856444214
Proposal for a joint resolution on human rights	0.882666024906185
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management.	0.6081358969739743
To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions.	0.8663273982709647
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice.	0.8531075784432828
The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time.	0.8343377606479754
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then, most important of all, working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities.	0.9326997445211971
Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed?	0.6133067133103912
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse.	0.5783883489186663
Question No 40 by (H-0095/00):	0.30359903246217335
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these.	0.8532255196626592
The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, or research and technical developments, within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion.	0.8331649090300667
We must also ensure that Amendment No 45 by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil is amended if it is to be adopted, because the same problem will arise.	1.0730622975138617
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Yugoslavia was what it was, in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people' s ethnic differences to a degree. It must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative.	0.9977968957923282
. Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development.	0.9437604055839621
After all, examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies.	0.771598454906758
The documents will in the main be open working documents.	0.6084729412114869
The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction.	0.8649554958099408
So, the Commission, in bringing forward their new proposals, must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services.	0.9920860365694257
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks.	0.5649630914174595
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?	0.9237419304657736
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear.	1.0720710002342602
Finally, we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements, because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry.	1.2456679311153676
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.	0.8356295531550181
Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.	1.1947360735239225
.	-0.0
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process.	0.9722061638443862
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.	0.906667266867236
This leaves it wide open to abuse.	0.36166462042312947
The project has been long and problematic.	0.5227350033445215
By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions, and not only as regards the Commission' s relationship with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission' s relationship with the Council.	1.1946702944690284
Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients;	0.8238705483121369
I agree with this request.	0.7421966853653619
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities.	1.0509257742040417
The new strategy outlined by the Commission communication on tourism and employment, and agreed by the Council, places the emphases on tourism gathering and disseminating information and good practice.	1.0156864808420742
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers.	0.7467266870520038
Firstly, to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to LIFE funds exclusively to public bodies, subsequently, following invitation to tender, to entrust the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations.	0.8154871306009419
We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security.	0.9835840764712745
Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.	1.1206139618057187
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment.	0.9550185267697134
After all, it is only 1% of GDP, by comparison with national spending.	0.9255784837712342
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.	0.8242053866686169
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report. This does, of course, contain a number of good observations.	0.6924578634857242
I did not hide behind any immunity.	0.43423763772025076
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.	1.0257658113641757
Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000).	1.0007026871932254
Today, at the end of the 20th century, a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency.	1.1997471061127656
In the divided situation which has now arisen, we therefore consider that the Council' s wordings are the best.	0.9910685411934724
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security, I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me.	0.8260970229724695
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform.	1.0702354632725612
However, the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis, represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens.	1.0732505757139306
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.	0.40961004994857386
Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres.	0.9436353935927186
Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating. Article 178, Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows: "The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries" .	0.7962395292959067
This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990.	0.7971583556685692
Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.	0.7765238919620698
The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas.	0.6464466453569883
This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version.	0.8839391941266461
Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process.	0.7472179772987669
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE.	0.9487450731700178
It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks.	0.9141890773446607
The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed.	0.901029247120748
We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy, and we know that, with the creation of the High Representative, of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity, there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies. We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue, with the adoption of common positions or joint actions, with the preparation of joint strategies, with preventive diplomacy, and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management.	1.1867232142295263
The cost will not therefore disappear, but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed.	1.0072617813261124
In whose interest is it really if European taxpayers' money is used to support economic development in Namibia, and if, at the same time, the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies, financed by the same tax payers?	0.9561986106756564
Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster. During these visits, I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement.	0.7474757623652662
There is one problem that I hesitate to mention today as I am new in the sector.	0.7320425308029906
Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties: the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations, performances and phonograms.	0.9609705022873993
The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States.	0.7769763886807498
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that, given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations, the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants.	0.8888327229624854
People should no longer be forced to move.	0.6247321769886077
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy' s report, the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention, the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and, finally, the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes, on the basis of a real partnership.	1.0411031155403907
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety, Mr Byrne.	0.7959975777516373
Mr Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council.	0.7163356924355706
The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.	1.009059141082512
Third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union.	0.7937221619835505
The second point is human resources.	0.7283362928534819
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter' s report.	0.8881669008677193
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want.	0.8496110731280075
Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme (B7-4012).	0.43656594015043687
That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science.	0.7098644401737272
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas!	0.8969335586681162
As there is no vaccination, farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie.	0.6955866346634463
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable.	0.6470943381467229
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances.	0.8943526416170137
This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4).	0.6846162534288389
This sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations.	0.9302975714864019
We shall obtain the very opposite of what we want.	0.8710309080450755
The debate is closed.	0.12840719496303654
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.	1.274337006784162
Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow.	1.0219753502005733
Mr President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return, with respect for their own heritage and their own culture.	0.9402872557556132
However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up.	0.9971818386757575
They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary.	0.9307316349588319
That is important.	0.5252566052247096
At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter.	0.8766472749108822
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.	0.8988761421149981
We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive, taking the text on which Directive 70/524 is based as a starting point.	0.7741890148002285
Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European "one-stop" system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.	0.9037337272868841
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders.	1.0634815165230531
. (FR) We are disappointed by the Council' s common position on this proposal for a framework directive.	0.9873378241507317
Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties, if it appeared that, as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment, they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established?	1.16651728072988
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.	0.99404814212671
But there is a common factor, a hard core, comprising unemployment, the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises, both commercial and other kinds.	1.0316601373741292
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries.	0.7703114406912045
The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.	0.7973930698943188
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its relevant role to play.	1.0623806735864465
As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States.	0.8041799667301569
This must not, however, be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution.	0.733853577469797
We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision.	1.0948618651103939
Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward.	1.086135993970278
In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Confederal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Nogueira Román, on LEADER.	0.883064514109211
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point.	1.0306399512688171
No.	-0.0
He went back to work, rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions, but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round.	0.7987576628678467
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.	0.9306498979991017
That is my initial response to the threshold question.	0.8163793292115343
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.	1.0234779915593006
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer, the vendor, or whoever, should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost.	0.8708615675379525
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully.	0.4923623353540072
In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President.	1.352251553743519
It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered.	1.0159398966819781
II. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses (COM(1998) 451 - C4-0465/1998 - 1998/0242(COD))	0.7041402448289165
At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens.	0.9339089632651909
We asked for a whistle-blower' s regulation, and this is now in place.	1.0206410019531422
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change.	0.7002512763916645
Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times.	0.45407184468279027
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid.	1.0218254222077232
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under.	0.9820939667422658
First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations.	1.0933184986297457
Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities.	0.6996571263468591
I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason.	0.6146838046264932
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?	0.7846833131191006
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.	0.7937931744631622
The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the European Union have been positive.	0.8789574850158289
While, since the dawn of time, the market has been the key forum for human interchange, it has never been perfect.	1.180737020634394
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.	1.1490955040068813
In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.	0.8352856018849087
I believe that the fact that Culture and, fittingly, Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner' s remit, will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes, which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union.	0.9543688299468147
Mr President, I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups.	0.9761178296253741
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years.	0.9144237885832914
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away.	1.269646525087971
What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation.	0.6697184865222189
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks.	0.7715613389186403
In this field the Commission, in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be held on drugs in February.	1.0324487306962116
There is neither coherence nor human decency here.	0.40023344414355466
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.	0.39854946759903653
I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies, in terms of both finance and management.	0.9639645738185324
As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia.	0.6682878173800673
We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process.	0.45363508791891644
Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority.	1.0362197313421924
I wholeheartedly agree.	0.23826934094017704
I am anxious to know how effective the EU' s policy planning and early warning unit has been.	0.7103063550949299
Already weak economies are being further weakened in Africa by the AIDS virus.	0.6143538527809352
A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised.	0.559703096706426
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia.	1.102650153202404
Regarding this problem of partnership, I shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the Structural Funds regulations are applied properly.	0.9591317471752865
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now.	1.1760793097754905
During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved.	1.0608443013390292
Just look at transport policy; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries.	0.699605842590084
It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.	0.8720371914435587
In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe.	0.7492923221667562
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	0.7977412572344633
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal.	0.7300570107682377
Madam President, particularly out of respect for you, for myself and for this House, I did not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question. However, as a Member of this House, as general secretary of a party in the Basque Country and as an ordinary citizen of Spain, I will do so now because of the extremely serious accusations made against individuals and against parties like my own, which has a long democratic tradition, and which has scrupulously respected and defended human rights for many years.	1.0756359188094962
We therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council' s functions as a legislative body.	0.8634927422154454
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular.	1.0594508967171838
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March.	0.8132727837910863
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.	0.9309911736660333
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise, although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission' s support programmes.	0.9041339171131954
There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone.	0.7262481827437899
External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation.	0.5743582522062571
So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo.	0.7138838437258491
First, I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities.	1.0443741727724125
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta.	1.01442870487789
In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries.	0.9891403279921824
We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy, in accordance with the objectives set, that is to say, the social, economic, environmental and democratic management dimensions, as well as the relationship between them.	1.0806993677496448
The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support.	0.9871461854293342
A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions, the most recent of which dates from July 1999.	0.8208308765413409
These have, in fact, clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits.	0.7890706272643063
I respect Parliament' s wish, as it has been expressed, but I must also say that the self-determination of peoples cannot be called into question, even by the European Parliament.	1.180906333618312
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed.	1.1704991631067807
Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring?	0.8135005429038586
Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.	1.0321480904374423
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.	0.7335503325808342
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation.	0.756805406943614
We do not want Africa to become our cross, in fact quite the contrary.	1.1509453746387779
At the same time, unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.	0.6941503345071408
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.	0.9537367858542001
This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee.	0.8467726205288274
By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government.	0.7725873164360735
As we see it, such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot, therefore, be supported.	0.7719965629213471
Secondly, what will happen to the European defence industry which, after all, comes under the more general activities relating to this system?	0.9524441572863537
I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi.	1.058110470226903
Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance.	0.7707462955406046
But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on.	1.0666729535008144
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work.	0.9566380091399007
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this.	1.0935448697672616
We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates.	0.9530178654256972
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.	0.5926004874092965
Incidentally, the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament.	1.0335577558510414
It is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for Europe, tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the European Union' s regions.	0.895190416387822
Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies.	1.0020495576471402
That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money.	0.8429592916590757
My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia' s problems, but more particularly Serbia' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia.	1.1062876722527328
In addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the Member States: greater financial flexibility between strand A and strand B. Thanks to these two overtures, especially the first, I can say that the Commission is willing to examine the case of Italian regions and regions of third countries around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG, and with other instruments too, as soon as they become available.	1.0599997386343891
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.	0.7795292072651974
The vast majority of them are not members of any party.	0.7101568185709338
Specifically, I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco. This is a country with which the European Union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration.	1.1854088585626634
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work.	0.7339488596503044
In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course.	0.947009734310297
We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice.	0.5051808332925812
The idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone, is not workable.	0.9719156151823632
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020.	1.0078326546149756
Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to.	1.2842114899026567
I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy.	1.0815490199546993
Mr President, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions, I have to say that I am not moved, rather I am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time, and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union!	0.9906500457934119
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.	1.1557084583469859
This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal.	0.7809292161706032
At best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis. Yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work.	0.7594881002188696
Fourthly, government debt is defined in accordance with ESA 95, as are the flows or interest stemming from assets/liabilities.	0.6716439871306288
I am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties, opening new prospects for this partnership.	0.7040812693276723
Commissioner Byrne, it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament.	0.9138172794294043
The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme.	0.9840985283365801
Apart from a few exceptions, the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party will vote in favour of the committee' s amendments, and of course our own.	1.0352487714143517
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party.	0.8772031917234293
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science.	0.7005535985726072
No farmer, anywhere in the world, will produce something if prices are too low.	0.744053366242735
Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe.	0.8507029520434186
However, up till now, Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation.	0.6373364967776742
For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle' s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have.	0.9724869289144925
Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed.	1.345887170399973
Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies.	0.8831199304608909
I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada.	0.9312666202647513
The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003.	0.7189642298572394
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice, even in the appointment of judges.	0.851700424745848
We must therefore ensure that the EU provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another. This has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way.	1.043233945117315
There are reputable companies too.	0.3264164297098556
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid, which may be assimilated in some way into state aid.	1.0225369323989606
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory.	0.6299057573678041
Above all, Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language, clearly, by changing to some extent the jargon which we use, because we cannot ask the Europeans, who are living through profound changes, to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible.	1.0567077539429912
Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent.	0.679986416575302
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. The Members on the right should note this.	0.7316421827809136
Over the same period, Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.	0.4273811207875279
On the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet, at the very same time, the EU Member States are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging.	1.0559620216193484
We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.	0.7468788397111236
It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution.	1.1465600727431302
It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold.	1.058676731153195
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission' s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all.	0.9746710653062747
There is a need for more coordination, more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided.	0.9144817874113779
There is no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider' s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements, which are also anti-European.	1.030214756981702
Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match. We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available.	1.129389645382122
In Finland, an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic, with the words "Good morning, Madam President."	0.8799537858055199
But who defines these tasks?	0.1915754929404329
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects.	0.7708326588633598
The draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the Treaty.	0.9883642234724445
This is something we have borne in mind.	1.0306698994267003
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for all her work and her cooperative attitude, even if we have agreed to differ on certain points.	1.0017660545780123
This is what we wish to do: maintain our role as a supranational structure, maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties, but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts.	0.8460785809649511
Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	0.7646464588850029
For example, Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country' s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely.	0.6967294490541887
With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.	0.9805077506462283
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system.	0.49303523345729205
I wish to discuss two matters.	0.39192270964523895
I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere - the entire European political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter.	1.2635090292586106
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.	1.2178584325468342
The Commission, in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission.	0.9202127467219076
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions.	0.9680195331278085
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee' s amendments, which they adopted unanimously.	1.0940959882325751
This means that, when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences, job losses for example, companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution.	0.6401630493817209
The Commission proposes redistributing the INTERREG funding as follows: between 50 and 80% for strand A, 6% for strand C, and the remainder for strand B, i.e. from 14 up to a maximum of 44%.	0.8129884494756213
It is about a Commission which is no more.	1.1321155181005869
The emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities, non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces.	0.7517654789229482
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the Union are actually active frontiers of the Union, even if, or precisely because, they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear.	0.8961012736974563
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure.	0.9892730089057261
Turning briefly to Angola, we had again a number of knowledgeable speeches, especially from Mr Soares, with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject.	0.9392661752292985
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there.	0.8665006630766616
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.	0.40978308686566745
You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers.	0.6489006414039636
It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies.	0.49878806927439906
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr Désir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect.	1.1845052643788427
We now come to the third proposal which is for 'Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.	0.7508931102772893
The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community.	0.6973672779241321
Secondly, a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.	0.9268499833479205
Madam President, I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre.	1.1991000272019576
That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product, the subject matter of the application.	0.8897741128383503
It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework.	1.1337048379204966
Strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste.	0.5811352768879846
The protective measures cover these countries too, and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight.	0.874349765280934
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo.	0.8254858800459409
In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.	0.884849636512568
For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening, that reflects a rapid decline in quality, while at the same time prices are sometimes rising, which is something else we must note.	0.8422925856872372
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice.	0.6415245898740785
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.	0.5204770878931915
Do you think I am going over the top?	0.8238368241055974
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment.	0.5581511539749899
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.	1.4461633119342123
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.	0.9140836195209918
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3.	0.4773902548511242
After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future.	0.8961480063127268
I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.	1.126132757350972
Does "the European integration model as a rich source for global administration" imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power?	0.8222126663545022
In view of this positive action, there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work.	0.8606532368385045
You are most welcome.	0.27329773078949576
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.3437607038227892
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	0.7576816207306724
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.	0.721410442269768
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval.	1.174841577843076
It also has excellent cultural and relational links, through twinnings for example. INTERREG III, strand A, would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium-sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer.	0.874205059557147
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another.	0.6266917774442338
However, the Council will certainly let you have a concrete reply on the options available for acting in the case you have mentioned.	1.197648488506427
On 24 December, the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper, Expresso, to a year' s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000.	0.7388587200317072
What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made.	0.9861483572808449
This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself.	1.0113481560972353
Recently, the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions.	0.7705293839135141
The next item is the report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD)).	0.5572234605403819
Nothing could be further from the truth!	0.46908619052243317
The Union, like everyone else, has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation.	1.1494973944500262
This is not an option for us any more.	0.9495660746144599
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters.	0.8015529793842491
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union.	1.09720607376712
Despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER+, I do still have one further concern.	0.9183240851981073
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.	1.147105908645842
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand.	0.9044837081801411
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee.	0.884550528234058
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government. This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi' s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party.	0.7856431086881571
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.	0.8985555371748127
The system currently in force creates transparency, affords enterprises legal certainty and has, without a shadow of a doubt, led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement.	0.717979551451462
It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens.	0.6348584846323817
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market?	0.7929633336207003
Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.	0.8114653464901834
Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular.	0.8214747004728764
Nor is it possible to support the rapporteur' s call for the European Development Fund to be merged with the Community budget.	0.9588025797745112
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding.	0.713780659481671
Question No 47 by (H-0088/00):	0.3713873565353549
I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here.	0.9193231661246853
I will mention two point that may create tension.	0.5279242692160995
The fourth group is legal certainty.	0.38209287831137884
We accept that Europeans, particularly the younger generation, need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead.	0.9259613357406332
What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation.	1.018055870255098
There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle.	0.8845351493961304
Most of the report is about financial control.	1.1961635524960013
At the Commission's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded.	0.9155168785264877
We are also concerned with the question of cooperation.	1.0359034879864806
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision.	0.868529621197498
In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999.	0.7584986549319568
You did not call me either.	0.3905245840534081
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted.	0.7934911171510273
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process.	0.5220346028386881
The next item is the report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/00 - 1999/0240(CNS)).	0.5978569100912836
Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product.	0.4216809860830315
Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech.	1.0702111363989844
The only arguments against it are: firstly, it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America.	0.9854175174516795
This is repulsive most of all in social terms.	0.6840452119322785
Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.	1.1212451443068927
Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.	1.0878642278593105
The Commission' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed.	0.9190993728998907
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe.	0.885278043831214
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament.	0.9871001454500525
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.	0.9362131662349403
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage.	0.2756567774777824
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.	0.7575804016636607
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	0.5720758265256998
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable.	0.7294883460145909
Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported.	0.9970837015983379
And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given.	0.7399969839605499
Public monopolies are, more often than not, phased out reluctantly.	0.7869811409048972
Can you?	-0.0
Madam President, we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union, so that we can uphold them together.	1.064923636649675
It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur.	0.8163231859793537
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives.	0.671703285015602
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	0.5634949048222385
The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations.	0.8350553537269396
We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35% ...	0.8777750995920176
Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas.	0.8204091710200135
It is quite the opposite.	0.8833129990935813
First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites.	0.7794268864923529
The fate of Andrey Babitsky, the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops, is a dramatic example of Russian policy.	0.9091732146988243
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do.	0.7917280155138329
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be, in my view, a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability.	0.8838754365957489
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject.	1.0476783753007264
That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked.	1.1780878719826315
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?	0.814402625892719
That is why, and I quote, this framework decision "is confined to supplementing the provisions of the International Convention of 20 April 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its Protocol" , i.e. the provisions of a timeworn international convention that is a good 71 years old.	0.9716929073803746
Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time.	0.8523375152886052
So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from.	0.9304454268330694
In addition to a report of this kind, I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character.	1.0130197611862954
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman.	1.1593599295332784
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut.	0.9350719246593913
We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals.	0.8773769841762192
But here too, within the European Union, expectations are high.	0.6630023674338298
We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together.	1.1893199488256336
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.	0.753453452170251
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.	0.9600532001013814
Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia.	0.9497597067727364
What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs, for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity, because sometimes, as the title of the film states, the postman always rings twice.	1.0772216824620386
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme.	0.895628109732877
Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson.	1.315072321764355
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.	0.7851986757772723
For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian.	0.7753497478445817
I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means.	1.1366996379224414
I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving.	0.9563226937140132
I have mentioned the example of social services before: nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer, including the pensioner in an old people' s home, and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition, whether that is the right course.	1.0010786096848754
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable.	0.8745451030815369
It is inconceivable that the European Parliament, which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights, should fail to adopt a clear stance on this.	0.8199375674650502
One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs.	0.8097452379086073
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.9015998294755034
Madam President, as my dear friend Elly will know, I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy.	1.1032426296699827

Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe' s ambitions in the area of CFSP.	0.8238994232057979
The INTERREG initiative, launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations, sits comfortably within this philosophy.	0.7123768861132691
The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term.	0.9039800632154166
Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?	0.828549389260522
I think, however, that common rules have to be applied to this sector, so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the Wild West, or even the Wild East. We need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service.	1.0783501758723806
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge.	1.1694521930708783
It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty).	0.9032337133252615
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts.	1.088550227238298
Therefore, while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality, with employee rights, which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid, public social protection system, we harbour serious doubts as to its position.	0.9772272809044118
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas.	0.9269954001891295
For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	1.1196076549840934
This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April.	0.6701315597528259
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.	0.7384155854595886
In particular, as agreed at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February 2000, the European Union intends to table draft resolutions on the Israeli settlements, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma/Myanmar, a draft chairman' s statement on Colombia, and, possibly, on East Timor, together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries.	0.9414641043314516
When there is growth, it must be better distributed, but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness, be they the most remote or island regions, is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.	0.9266336178646932
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.	1.0899497045528659
Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic, something we have long talked about.	0.6805944842555699
Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.	1.05837380060395
We are all aware of the difficulties, and particularly the financial difficulties, that Mr Kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery, and, in particular, we are aware of the special difficulty involved in recruiting police so as to ensure day-to-day public safety.	1.1396391021290095

I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system.	0.8803025937024876
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer, as stipulated in the common position.	1.017636378612902
I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health.	0.9587511013593912
I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves.	1.124358974502296
It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, "I am the one that the Americans phone up" .	0.878132042021651
I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards.	0.5233060918693669

The new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms, including a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority.	0.9633000707365537
The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes.	0.942340097129238
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography. 'We are in Europe.	0.7641293617068664
But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development.	0.8380815242936991
Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions.	1.0059059650744104
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment.	0.9312668978177533
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns.	0.6707441762820853

I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday, 6 March, in order to talk to Minister Ringholm, to members of the Swedish parliament, and, if necessary, also to the Prime Minister or other ministers, in order to continue discussions on this matter. I am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in Sweden regarding this issue.	1.054753137612166
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies.	0.8021785825562068
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.	1.0219420869474436
The European Union' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the "stabilisation and association process" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability.	0.8247345798665566
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.	0.8415970923000894

Low wages, the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard huts - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are abominable and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves.	0.9005708935985046
There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted.	1.0108456223602182
I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes.	0.9583051332361686
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	0.7856986321028219
I feel that today' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institutions, with Austria or Mr Haider' s party.	0.9649162485010115

Finally, we have to put our trust in, and support, the institutions which are closest to the citizens, that is, the local councils and bodies.	1.2153894409479795
This is the price of the future of generations to come.	1.0229352773874487
In my opinion, this directive is unacceptable for this reason.	1.1995348498574732
It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.	0.7292989767288849

My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development.	0.9106716097730072
Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question.	0.912796334349306
The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion.	0.8084101371766184
In addition, the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.	0.855570885862216
The Commission' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health.	0.9484748084370703

However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results, such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation, composition and competences of the Community Courts.	0.9040588250190508
Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union.	0.9199347787281209
The House will be aware, of course, that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone.	1.074178710468793
Clear progress must be visible.	0.22695048226230818
I consider that this is a serious defect and that, in principle, it does not befit our legal system.	1.065706676865548

I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament.	0.7468046524090866
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative.	0.9781504688743755
Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency.	0.5101405925487656
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999, the Commission' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council.	1.2157374982104199
However, the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and, therefore, we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements.	0.9495791711247787
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods.	0.7378907705754385
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it.	0.8075425701012156
The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow.	0.8088730640640915
As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word "trade" at all.	0.8694757957967213
From what I have said, it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer.	1.016882101034274

In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present.	0.9401730816496756
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars.	0.8852324882641397
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern.	0.38801861032317203
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.	0.9213331738660417
We must begin by writing off debts. We must follow up words with action.	0.7615089685227108
We consider it to be of utmost importance that, in terms of financial control, personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts, we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy, for the benefit of the citizen.	1.0184536999825338
On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe.	0.6616021952310919
It concerns the next IGC.	0.7929988738952878
If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours.	1.1089899204021252
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because, as we see it, programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence.	1.2388061212084231
There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy.	0.9144708187402455
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat; common - policy with such an economic, social and regional impact, and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe?	1.0591725776945005
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	0.712102941293032
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments.	0.9953924800383102
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.	1.074287158189258
I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever.	0.9079797214791884
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission' s view that LEADER+ should be applied in all rural areas, that overriding priorities should be introduced and that, above all, active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged.	0.7694099690583156
That is not guaranteed.	0.8755137541106779
I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible, especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries, especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE.	1.0903351371960446
We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do.	1.052774601922571
For me personally at least, difficulties were caused by the directive' s technical division into two different proposals, which certainly did not make it easier to familiarise oneself with this very difficult technical subject.	0.8442964008840204
Firstly, LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union.	0.880844857493475

Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost.	0.5945672436924029
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government, but also at the Socialists, who are European citizens as well, because, at the moment, the Austrian Socialists are being described as traitors to their country.	0.9154414973705728
The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic, including all people, whatever their nationality, or excluding some.	1.0181462641738956
Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system.	0.8051883814348009
Mr Rapkay' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law.	0.7996536723351289

Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable.	0.8844538305295556
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were.	0.7470941187996323

Too late, too selective and too fragmented: this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community.	1.0462850030515933
I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned.	1.1011052326127937

My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma.	0.9649021773908816
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions.	0.8773256976026655
Madam President, I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning.	1.0091485621936602
The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).	0.5306267370495664
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.	0.6534065190327224
Parliament, therefore, can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn.	1.0306158938273593
- Additionality is a major issue too in Wales, which I represent.	0.9600504828363113
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.	0.8778856529437253
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report. She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.	1.0313021362868589
It would be the first in a long time.	1.1668777397317924
My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case?	0.6069632080717927
But they might accidentally do great damage.	0.289687434624809
Is this not a contradiction?	0.6165219003410223
In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries?	0.8852303122736993
The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.	0.6625223575156514
This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States.	0.8402391091948689
This is not the case!	1.0470043421660462
Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.	0.9650372898437505
We must emphasise Europe' s spiritual history.	0.5785529613151685
Joint motion for a resolution on the negotiations to form a government in Austria	0.9131037396986628
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you.	0.7747720014612206
Finally, we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, using the increased information available on their chemical, physical and biological properties, in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage, which is fundamental to us all.	0.9581060904535148
Lastly, I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact.	1.1135654169454727
As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities?	0.8689568018954079
The situation is more akin to a black hole in space, sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes.	0.5794819352280343
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network.	0.7442906843022041
I therefore wonder whether the Commission' s package on postal liberalisation will include the preservation of free competition, because it is very possible that - as has happened in most sectors in the Community today - it will lead to concentrations of large companies which will cancel out the benefits of this theoretical liberalisation.	1.07467433687981
Why would it not work elsewhere?	0.5771360263693284
The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures, and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February.	0.8399042395447885
The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations' health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that.	1.0786455799447514
The aim of these regional policies, which, of course, are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State, i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme, is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women.	0.9219172232327455
On the other hand, we can go a long way using the existing tools.	0.9324343516310264
Because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach, a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were.	0.8870427413668605
Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when, on the continent of Europe itself, the right to life is at risk?	0.7653110668480015
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons, nor have the loyalist terrorists, yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community.	0.9510500737194525
Financial control will be absolutely secured, both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes, and because we will introduce a completely professional, independent internal audit service.	1.025609049497319
The matter of the European Union' s recognition of a high-quality postal service, available to all, remains valid today, and we are increasingly concerned.	1.0104541916306697
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers' liability.	0.8571665350376436
You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil.	0.6050054317368541
This is not the case here.	1.107075994756401
Mr President, with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon, I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them, that is, the URBAN programme.	1.0457438347148975
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness.	0.5656904453052319
I shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name FYROM, which as you must know, is the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years, under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolutions, but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of 1995.	0.8919856025195743
To strengthen the role of tourism in Europe, the organisations should do what has happened in most economic sectors: seek better focus, better coordination and concentrated activities.	0.8895216248344539
Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened.	0.9021941409275139
In an article entitled "If women ruled the world" , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics, the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence.	0.7575778478090804
Mr President, I was a little disappointed with the answer given by the President-in-Office to my colleague.	1.056124103891671
However, increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation.	0.5457036355029634
In other words, we do not need to re-negotiate the text; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive.	0.9144769974960671
No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position.	0.8246883390684894
There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job.	0.7126110480737433
The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.	0.7717525256206992
Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask, in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing, to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies, particularly in development, because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right.	0.9601856911346659
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector, so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented. In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP.	0.8881816706560338
An area of special concern is the harassment of journalists, including temporary detention of members of the so-called independent press.	0.8015647251395531
We had, as usual, many debates on countries where there are war situations.	0.8979820411652913
Madam President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associate itself with the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party.	0.8312776100890734
I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today.	1.0462559792930415
Amendments Nos 4, 11, 12, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metals.	0.6311317498103038
Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment.	1.0766661427989048
It should not be the case that one Member State, under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle, can decide that all funding should go to one group.	0.8569908904799425
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.	1.1163207420048804
In addition, there is a clear tendency, in matters of international jurisdiction, more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction.	1.0507347955498705
Yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies, both individuals and States. This reaction was more organised than previously, due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular.	0.7219275480949213
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested.	1.2307684673842767
We are now faced with a number of common challenges, however; demographic development, for example, which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate.	1.036072547626299
This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy, and especially in the agricultural sector.	0.9112325091610312
Moreover, the cost will have to be borne in the future.	1.2429401187193392
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers?	0.5418339675803501
I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission, since the evaluation, control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects.	0.8571142860818886
The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI.	0.5416096460371721
Malta, Cyprus and Turkey were not provided for at this stage.	0.6145524577333401
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities, for both the Serb and Romany populations, and the incidents of discrimination, harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region.	0.8549361217192252
In that way, we can act as a model for the applicant States.	1.0727934916445752
The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas.	0.767145114924099
There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy' are not used.	0.7819606048783001
Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights, which is being discussed at the moment, to become enforceable in law.	1.2561367857426826
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters, the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France.	0.7902339871720869
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.	0.3954096838288247
It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least.	1.3714409436568753
This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone.	1.0456156228404847
I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM.	1.0403201833673559
We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.	1.082151668653723
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.	0.8676724240451068
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out, and also the Commission - why not? - because this report, this position, generally improves on the texts in force.	0.9355622906750503
There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries, 90% of which are our ACP partners, estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15%.	0.7848983968311399
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either; there will be more.	0.8530903856567811
Secondly: the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime, including by Europol and Eurojust.	0.7377712084449756
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved.	1.1671011752590175
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!	0.7414420652272944
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too.	1.060536914137678
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration.	0.6402806455163139
With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia, higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention.	0.6738445393234667
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime.	0.9613833210900944
Regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up, in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one.	1.113547366316005
This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider.	1.100465487923379
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.	1.0124747377675543
Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic, but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control, which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment.	0.8558162884935375
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.	0.9128206631421764
But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years' time.	0.5199725604809204
I would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work. He listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage, and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence, both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance.	0.9551283554584482
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons. Firstly, the authorisation system; secondly, decentralised application; thirdly, procedural rules; fourthly, judicial application; and fifthly and finally, excessive red tape.	0.7610263524143759
It is thus, as you can see, a very important draft, that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance.	1.2240582027523859
I cannot accept this.	0.5600803767140551
If we do not take steps to deal with that, we will fail ultimately.	1.1347987708410412
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous.	0.9988022163230832
This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants.	1.0708119808828065
We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education.	0.5430356792467685
Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation.	0.8398723394457168
Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect.	0.43141721905521274
You know that there is a Parliamentary delegation chaired by Mr Méndez de Vigo and a Committee on Constitutional Affairs where these issues can be debated at great length.	0.6728644653036024
Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent.	0.826694819460055
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.	1.1596741664425885
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.	0.80533811214278
Parliament has taken due note of your comments.	0.7824386679512143
We think they should.	0.4040157719695415
Madam President, I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that, during the conciliation procedure, I was personally a little disappointed with the Council.	1.1496570276201559
It is, therefore, surprising that this topic has, to date, not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission' s notification constitutes a break-through in a way.	0.9943375745911418
From an Irish perspective, I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles.	0.8677350726087526
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised, i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty.	0.8954652691872949
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally?	0.7140603180699099
Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate.	0.8313745051121106
We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that.	0.6482100384181227
Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM	0.5161239695000253
The next item is the report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union.	0.7281504371391317
The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits.	0.9421721561902331
This is very positive as this is how the national parliaments, on which the governments depend, will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to European construction.	1.1025518467502338
For you, the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa.	0.8249937284478828
That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed.	0.95229361937038
Mr Gollnisch, excuse me, you have one minute.	0.727527162911016
So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment.	0.9333553079716054
The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place. It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled 'sustainable urban policy' .	1.0364147678645197
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures, in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities.	1.1334197450746522
As the White Paper makes clear, the new authority must be a value-added structure.	0.850307805424551
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	0.7096897100363789
Let me, in this connection, welcome the presence in the visitors' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque, spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Marée noire" , made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.	0.7551889630986606
Mr President, in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses, one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands.	1.1969019746458311
Finally, I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are, in any case, familiar with, but whose main elements I should like to reiterate.	1.0032117753648593
We are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter.	0.860958034827193
Would this be in the interests of Europe's citizens?	0.7385746994681921
Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.	0.9235829539545743
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.	0.8425353037399377
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union' s goals.	0.845224060774039
We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted, and most important of all, we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is disinheriting them and leading them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside.	0.7388131097912848
It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question.	1.012408593426942
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	0.2719031752992343
There is a blatant discrepancy here!	0.6073407759464793
They put their own petty squabbles first, and the rest is history.	0.8130548465499536
As this is the case, whatever solution is found, I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their national positions on the matter.	1.064317142007969
The charter will extend to third country nationals in Member States even though certain rights will be reserved to nationals of Member States of the Union.	0.7613135288579536
Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals.	0.9633553576396398
Hitherto, such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically, and was of no use to our services; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself.	0.8150428758490594
(FR) The proposed action and programme presented by Mr Prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again.	0.7836491372218339
Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out.	0.9742192594471408
The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian 'Mother Earth' organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation.	0.8711487050095392
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world.	1.0608416566609535
I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste.	1.1402819132053053
There are huge reserves; certain zones, rural zones, so-called zones lagging behind but which still have unspoilt nature and untouched natural habitats, are listed as having good potential for what we call eco-tourism or green tourism.	0.8077795005064057
As you can understand, it would be easy to do so.	1.1687271752402002
We have arrived at the final question.	0.4813974499004721
For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved.	1.1158217580627554
Whatever Jörg Haider' s verbal excesses, which we of course deplore, the Austrians have made a democratic choice, and we must respect this.	1.0505177732714406
The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio.	0.9871132691798732
As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor?	1.239244597058851
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March, also coinciding with the Council of Ministers, and, of course, before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, for us to have texts to discuss.	1.0716147371069764
The United Nation' s, and Mr Kouchner' s, mission in Kosovo ended in failure.	0.8379770169850248
This derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year.	0.5809857398864945
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it, you would consider it.	0.9195239482104463
Many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President, Fernando Cardoso, the Finnish Government, the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in 1995.	0.7688978229155776
I believe that it is important to point out one thing: expenditure effected under LEADER+ is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running.	0.881098335196481
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.	0.7078551358635088
On the same day, I understand, Mr Balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead.	1.043812190930521
I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur.	1.0511936232653898
But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.	0.8889013130867566

High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.	0.5050180025450963
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	0.8246458220791235
B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	0.5734129746104691
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds.	0.8061215475314611
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force.	0.6627697294706347
Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment.	0.9045659588418115
This Parliament has been given more authority, so let us use it!	1.1366031048435514
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new.	0.688089331033305
The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well.	0.5396628653353162
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.	0.7742123030064846
As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us.	0.6827725196154342
Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more, to the benefit of more developed areas.	0.7813927779225303
Nothing has changed there.	0.402546955050221
The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation.	0.9894709975672142
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy?	0.9149592491058002
Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I would ask that this issue, which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union, be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years.	1.0427428836462949
Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows.	0.8305648403052038
Women in the decision-making process	0.27882542614112477
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.	1.1807177640797186
Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States.	1.0640512301918668
In addition, I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood, especially where Community contributions are concerned, should incentivise.	1.0430973505911414
I hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents.	1.0081696193121898
In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories.	1.039907546346968
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is.	0.6527525666874319
Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive.	1.2045001533744402
But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light?	0.8349948956823878
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system.	0.7311919586435814
With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself.	0.8979580526548835
From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.	1.15638637405506
This can only benefit our credibility.	0.5554780607171447
What is your opinion on that?	0.5539748473651214
I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court.	0.8396527902527015
Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice should be mentioned, we must remember that there is still room for progress.	0.8498312495489523
This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union.	0.8066925614282062
It is fine, in principle.	1.033832845899538
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date, stressing, particularly your rapporteur, the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted.	0.9519024106717152
This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless.	0.5684286415803976
It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool.	0.9364539483883776
Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned.	0.8449917800573666
The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect.	0.7729446343366677
The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters.	0.6823822610046808
This is what we have, and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken.	0.9554386484528105
In short, the issue is an important one.	1.143895561779165
It has led to a growth in mergers, acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets.	0.5749638031937463
I understand that on 26 January the association wrote to the College of Quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative.	0.6110839679667713
Mr President, in terms of human rights, there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya.	1.001136777188807
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.	0.9102224649512218
The Spanish Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were represented.	0.907543177671963
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets.	0.45842652716405546
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making.	0.7528100208375982
Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events.	0.6174412474362646
It must be known.	0.5269799198786395
Genuine transparency of the institutions' workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which, in my opinion, needs to be studied again, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9019730889414981
I agree with Parliament that the common position' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced.	0.7135690599970554
The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support.	0.7809050086410417
Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too.	0.8066138972796095
Is that the message we want to send out?	1.0295754730896836
We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report.	0.72553070150326
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture.	0.6202980991714955
I am sure that, with the willingness that you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of understanding between us, will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you.	1.268585820976944
We need to be able to confront fears and anxieties, because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself.	0.7851482852655746
I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection.	0.9708456035238184
In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol.	0.8587919962958217
Quite the opposite, in an enlarged Europe, Mr President, the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding.	0.9797701228658532
Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided.	0.982914397868781
I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice.	1.208790081130532
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	0.7173860187278359
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms.	0.9731958076919026
(FR) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed.	0.6676852450458977
We have made our views very clear to them.	0.6976464752268711
If not, why not?	0.5964100459649784
They also play a major role in maintaining links between people.	0.6898182099387521
But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years.	1.1951878624213634
All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector.	0.48498572360307785
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution.	0.5397237493593128
. (FR) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy.	0.7977037215902306
There is little disagreement amongst Members with regard to the first proposal.	0.7310116617992614
So, yes to liberalisation, but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation, rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission.	0.8798485466555979
I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States.	0.9652968965748755
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and, therefore, I hope to see him there soon.	1.011567575477423
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0799135775378272
However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki.	0.910926356372672
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present.	0.9428262309029772
Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?	1.0187195289001787
Mr Désir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution.	0.8010932353193317
That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions, ambitions for which, of course, there is a price.	0.6373627615729861
The article was carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions, in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered.	0.7220082718169171
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.	0.8571464872779784
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.3258836908281644
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.	0.782204965428032
That is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled; it favours all the languages of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it.	1.1180914192448244
We need to work.	0.7022275902353332
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU' s next round of enlargement.	0.6558025040576976
We have all the instruments, we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years.	1.271424858806571
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.	1.107161431704816
But there has been nothing for a year.	0.6890481041296574
It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible.	1.2674093764714955
That is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment, so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account, and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment.	0.8139459090351822
The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level, especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, which is quite obviously something I approve of.	0.9624478379839125
Finally, we consider that tourism can, in addition to being a growth factor, be a factor for democracy, and in this regard we are asking the Commission for a clear, conscious commitment.	1.237516469644578
It would be to our credit were the European Parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in Spain and throughout the Union are respected.	0.9217414822750831
I should, of course, like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament' s Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, particularly its chair.	0.7627410513828425
Moreover, the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006, when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market.	0.9962514432035603
The last question concerns the amount granted.	0.5244711273021709
The Commission' s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive.	1.098247898378037
Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark.	0.8040744729183152
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action.	0.8020185645515082
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.	1.1495083586775758
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State.	0.9359717828850664
(Loud applause)	0.15244882023801815
I would nevertheless like to say, with regard to the rights of the child, that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue, particularly for the Council of Europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up.	1.1865137503890193
They cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, though I must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia.	0.8915538737917776
The situation, however, is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation into the bargain.	0.9176203582929751
Madam President, I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan.	0.8084514899307059
Madam President, the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal.	1.0893048981493214
As Mr Nielson said, this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity.	1.0732125811753634
Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General.	0.9296903886051057
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.	1.072381877797402
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure.	0.7092868192312513
Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector.	0.9816804596664865
Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach.	1.1087740708332277
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.	0.8598821945333511
on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos, Somes, Tisza and Danube Rivers.	0.6407123895442792
Yet there is a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment.	0.7318480336288345
Mr President, we are partly to blame for this war.	0.9077975057570714
This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production.	0.8687268562360209
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.	0.8192821884000772
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union' s desire to communitise urban policy.	0.8457802442682425
There has to be a willingness to cooperate.	0.8757445405823208
It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas, and you yourself made reference to Belgium, Commissioner, where it has not really taken off.	1.052630257554386
We know what actually happened.	0.6409620423473836
I think Commissioner Patten understands that too.	0.35833892899182085
European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air transport - and the target, the focus, was always the consumer.	0.9310555781668501
Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts.	0.9192588698115307
Mr President, I am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between Parliament, particularly the Committee on Budgets, and the Commission, and we can assure you that, for our part, we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties.	1.2980728342625332
With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold - and, later on, uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination.	0.8857286080110411
One example of this is the 'Celtic' area which encompasses the territories of Brittany in France, Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland. This is an area whose locally-based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector.	0.7930992681529013
As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December.	0.9687834739040934
We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development.	1.1723813364948952
It is, above all, the manufacturer' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car' s life-cycle.	0.7633376001623853
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation.	0.7207576614516111
Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens, where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities.	0.8446987204397598
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance.	0.6102892346548237
However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions.	1.2032304075643376
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts.	1.1390759322807045
The EU' s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention, which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment.	0.9120224531690414
Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself.	1.2212623084446048
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent.	0.6909522896286521
I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallström, has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself, on the spot, what has happened.	0.9621436473479948
Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe, daring to stop them choosing their own fate?	0.544467284782938
Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate.	1.0200868005367136
One is subsidiarity.	0.1909298428560821
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the ideas of Amendments Nos 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and some parts of 27, which contain sensible suggestions, can be adopted, again formulated appropriately.	0.7818459694547781
We are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect, for example, that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living.	0.8526768329712061
In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime.	1.0511197335126568
I now come to the content of the report.	0.6983456434328387
Mr President, the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are.	0.8068648845420128
Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus.	0.7417959033162749
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process.	0.7508536749512638
The tax would be targeted at the right place: at the speculators.	0.7388238685285496
There is, as yet, no European Court case law on Efterløn, but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality.	0.7306185990181889
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.	0.7402506880892574
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.	0.7881369221230566
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I have read and re-read the Commission' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office.	0.8622393765401981
We anticipate, if I understand correctly, a report in September on core activities.	1.159349559219781
.	-0.0
I very much welcome the Commission's support for that bizonal, bicommunal, federal Cyprus for which the UN has campaigned for so long and which both the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side should be working hard to bring about.	0.9102591395215207
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU's food safety regime in the years ahead.	0.8574275780643626
Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.	1.022511296450144
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations.	1.1961807147178476
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council.	0.885646094843749
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information.	0.9154986702081023
We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.	1.064948403513203
There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another.	1.2251446041595329
This is the sort of thing that we want to avoid.	0.9509688651569961
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services.	0.6879679140742072
But as you will also be aware, we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence, together with the communication on development policy.	1.041896503748786
And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres?	0.6550193893335999
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.	0.9646569352856381
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply.	0.7966347141217891
I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on.	0.8528406371256008
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.	0.8386092606133954
Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.	0.46587325934384344
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs, of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime, is very political.	1.0085334212225026
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy, bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.	0.9441437211520877
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers.	0.770780316318719
We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992: this is the topic of this debate.	0.9409472326570247
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened.	0.5572105992638334
It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues, and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues.	1.1061798433459116
We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet, even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high.	0.5882778995001765
For this, of course, central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy, so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings.	1.0184682905738893
Madam President, despite the protests by the international press, we still do not know the fate of Mr Andrey Babitsky, the courageous Russian journalist who has worked intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of Chechnya and the destruction of the city of Grozny.	0.9418454937424022
Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension, both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good.	0.637683340171964
My second criticism follows on from the first.	0.7078990234969176
This body, for example, alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety, is already doing good work.	0.8112069840452035
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?	0.6745698552781786
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.	1.1283206921566928
We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content.	0.6678780562002735
This is what the Commission will be judged on.	1.361918116824599
Firstly, its continuity, which, in principle, I am not questioning.	1.2595014151109218
In 1998, we had 55 murders.	1.0766131398635042
Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange.	0.9737805424694351
Report (A5-0078/1999) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy (1998) (SEC(1999)0743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS))	0.7128353093223967
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.	0.7923615900243679
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents.	0.6147181085847508
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months.	0.9425878933313431
Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late.	1.0863571509495094
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.	0.8053474439962558
The EU Presidency' s "common reaction" against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified.	0.7391241698435027
The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues.	0.8748597163399858
However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.	1.077934596169095
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.	0.9286520660042312
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination, I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination.	1.0364541665738882
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion.	0.9104404984848108
The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned.	1.1416778312798013
In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be.	0.9877260980277959
We believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome.	1.1193286080784515
We can but thank the parliamentary committees, which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far-reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which, in its initial format, we did not find at all convincing.	1.0995087260846037
But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, - if they are not applied blindly, without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process.	1.1497794942053257
The current globalisation process is - and I quote - 'exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities' . The European Union' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations.	0.9533191252950246
I am a European and even a federalist.	0.9255240794686119
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible.	0.7411999758789939
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.	0.6050580314243992
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over.	0.9010015438515128
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one.	1.0965522623435648
We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for?	0.7772156414756687
This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in.	0.582041340142068
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!	1.0610506044389214
The second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day' s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island.	0.998174223422328
I have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the European Commission at the time, and I am also coming across documents from Post-Europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect.	0.9003749847165179
Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality.	1.0595406525391358
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.	0.9676095942671366
That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is, to a large degree, about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future.	1.1807581180021787
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change.	0.7174005515678491
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.	0.4839854026922413
Mr President, Mrs Stenzel, ladies and gentlemen, before addressing the EQUAL report itself, I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based.	1.0163619295571902
This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives.	0.7349097386571786
In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing.	1.070824072054609
Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe.	0.9927555794900423
It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example.	0.9059190690147236
I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation.	1.1204597273460848
The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty' s most negative points, since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right, a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists.	0.9362996947310394
It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women.	1.0055824728262168
Is the Commissioner aware that, of this 263 hm3, we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 for water supplies in the area of the Júcar, 7 for supplies in the southern area of the Júcar and the rest in the Segura, equally divided between supplies and irrigation?	0.8725426950353543
We should be aware, for example, that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil.	0.8045838418799909
There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention.	0.7680876814286479
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements.	0.7546616963696537
Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old.	0.5224815288853889
In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States.	0.9521583177163148
Unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum-seekers, we are not worthy of those European values which make up the European identity, as Vaclav Havel said here today, and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity.	0.9093947291213677
In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days.	1.1854164561274594
For my part, I do not wish to give up hope.	0.9511725944996565
I would remind Members that, according to the guidelines for these sittings, questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer.	0.8290531468029295
This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there.	0.9050388397741885
We warn that this coalition, if it is formed today, unacceptably legitimises the extreme right, directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation, which bring us together in this European Union.	0.8461285444243224
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer?	0.9205890668475142
I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.	0.981409664985183
The debate is closed.	0.17381103562372896
And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth.	0.9928937368146128
I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain.	1.482902368983984
Clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which is particularly mistimed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict slimming regime on the national budgets.	0.548843431677148
This is a small political decision which would bring major benefits, especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state, to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus, genuinely, to be rid of occupying forces.	1.0276136290796654
Briefly, these are the main points of the reform.	1.157996683752987
Mr President, the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable.	0.9388793264732282
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.	0.7438316505433459
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has, in our view, been overtaken by events because, following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee, this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by Parliament.	0.9308398402143561
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement.	0.8709661124532234
.	-0.0
I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water.	0.743437917850603
Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed.	1.0489548956593384
Mr President, Commissioner, I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	0.8100863139339165
There is effective legal precaution.	0.4488284870053268
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO.	0.774934116416385
It was about gradual liberalisation; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector.	0.9422109926377014
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about.	0.9590288712193143
It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life.	0.7502520567167008
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week.	0.7250772496428175
There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.	0.9340416874172304
Finally we are producing a census of immigrants.	0.4379070752037221
Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union.	1.1301306978729961
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary.	1.1415967769385433
When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness.	0.9624519534026513
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers.	0.6516606427921691
As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment.	0.8631071497591265
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices, because that would be a very serious matter indeed.	0.8504230866653872
Every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities.	0.6213950371751816
I would like to say that in Italy, considerable headway has been made in this sector; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-of-life vehicles off the market, but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high, and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market.	1.087772875341528
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.	0.47709943335411403
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration.	0.6503497579222954
Mr President, I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday.	0.8684910786844601
I can speak for my party, which championed Austria' s membership of the European Union in the early days.	0.9182218490530752
Neither will it stop raising vital issues. For example, how much progress are you willing to make and what measures, legislative or otherwise, will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings, child pornography on the Internet, drugs, and organised crime?	0.7483366296667342
From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament.	0.9733971885919204
More than anything, the country needs peace and quiet now, in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity.	1.030695049935572
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this.	0.7845600592862838
These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State.	0.5979460106477518
The mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent, more transparent and more democratic.	0.9044126312003165
Any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable; it is in violation of the European Treaty (Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam).	1.0885663136093024
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made?	0.6337227040629559
Key sub-goals are: promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income; secondly, safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable; thirdly, promoting social integration and fourthly, guaranteeing affordable, first-rate health protection.	0.5904197053255873
However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi.	0.8606150928682977
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy, the rights of the opposition, commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour....	0.7649291811710661
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters.	0.7582484600982782
The actual appropriations available for LEADER + compared with LEADER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% (from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER +).	0.6154034479994005
We were delighted to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with South Africa after four years of negotiations.	0.48842882870369714
Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.	0.9389980746491529
You mentioned 'women' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals.	1.116413268558046
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency.	0.5184726590042883
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	0.3346213532634256
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which, today, can only be removed at local authority expense, i.e. the taxpayers' expense.	0.958391345186386
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy.	0.9090121518832064
Thirdly, to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite.	0.8668457105023953
There is a second issue I would like to raise.	0.7716665862492625
The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006.	1.1262302923268508
But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives.	0.6447216915995317
The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences.	1.1673381255699384
These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years' imprisonment.	0.7102722873941592
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up.	1.0913025401655911
Above all, it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned, for example, as regards the Balkans.	0.9500523416592858
This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible.	1.0856078676454208
Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner, but it still takes far too long.	0.8429643297243153
But the figures tell the true story.	0.3491649298621922
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.	1.1160489209462205
We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector.	1.022122357991378
Tourism is a social, economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens, either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services.	0.7007254060837376
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order.	0.9697394258793329
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.	0.7169329709522436
However, I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General, because I think they were absolutely right.	0.8897301066497797
These include car manufacturers, second-hand car dealers, the federation of the car industry, the metal processing firms, shredding firms and the government.	0.7202638515908854
Austria, therefore, is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled, and even duty bound, to offer Austria his best wishes.	1.020230814135752
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.	0.5261106449493624
First Part	-0.0
This is no longer tolerable.	0.7413379555134963
The directive should not treat over-the-counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many Member States and were also used before.	0.7960604752047448
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000.	0.8025063811346987
It is essential for us to send the Commission a message of confidence about its role in this area.	1.0112537264486137
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it.	0.9378551574757449
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.	0.7370141898186213
Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.	1.308752348498908
The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met.	0.5665062704564956
A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff.	0.8154138061194296
We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya.	0.9819248581984968
This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years.	0.46453294712138976
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.	1.0117855681003498
I accept this; I take note of it as you do.	0.7938618333665465
It must be a 'development round' , in which developing countries, effectively excluded from previous rounds, are fully included.	0.8368063318788632
Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.	0.9473247266787275
Put more strongly, in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds, the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens.	0.7374281520018735
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco.	0.7109579307152153
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster.	0.7900630315030889
The eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim, to whit, preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries within the framework of the Lomé Conventions.	0.8918754134774681
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner.	0.7994685028388354
Mr Alavanos, I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner' s responsibilities, and I would like to make two very important points here. The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations.	1.1144403437826735
He should never have arrived in Spain, where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities.	0.5928616330560277
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth.	0.6591489721011913
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it.	1.0670800815800916
The real aims of LEADER + are the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2, in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO.	1.0123319212620894
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism.	0.7943674516459436
There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union' s ability to match words with action.	0.6839354278220671
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.8200291139450543
I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania.	0.8101386007309948
What I said and what I explained in a previous answer is that there are civilian targets linked with structures which are objects for military action, and you know as well as I do that some military actions not only go for military targets, but also for civilian targets and structures which are connected with military action.	0.8761498188924065
The fostering of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the Member States is not only unjustifiable, but, on the contrary, makes manifest the political expediencies and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them, to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit.	0.8742850390377949
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement.	0.7120783744724296
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments.	0.7911006247174673
Justice needs to be done in East Timor.	0.9874422005510269
What I can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working, for as long as it is involved with this matter, in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards Members of the European Parliament. We will also make the utmost effort with members of the Council, particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year, so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution, and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this House.	1.1512852100449469
We therefore welcome the Commission' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs.	0.8684952887663699
This is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap.	0.9187664935527298
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.	0.7993203007276806
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now.	0.846948487928193
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs.	0.6019229855765199
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge, as well as the BSE crisis.	0.665099068665906
This is a basic element of the decision.	1.0521464953975626
I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001.	0.8080873134529195
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power.	0.6826994891666265
In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate.	1.1021418047056302
Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter.	0.8745742599097276
The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change.	1.0346618530898617
I support the Council proposals in this, while deploring a certain lack of strength, a certain spinelessness, on the part of the Commission which will, however, have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis, with determination over time, since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy, they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end.	1.0618956565234858
Clearly, Parliament has its own representatives present, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos.	0.8785696445760417
In order to make our actions effective, we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present.	0.9226270732016761
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States.	0.4215147205823833
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions.	0.6851876396589605
In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area.	1.2011621245201547
Since 1993 the Commission's European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.	0.8809321083630897
This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing.	0.8689850292780676
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued.	0.867609391989885
We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results.	0.7484127722233971
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.	1.0452111145441467
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.	1.1615112142987942
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.9186711132605269
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative.	0.984712915439381
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?	0.5455186773274799
Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people.	0.893823782389494
1997 discharge	-0.0
The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries.	0.8417899611128329
The figure is now 5.35%.	0.49425880477538797
We will be organising and supporting actions including, in particular, the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.	0.9309101221020099
Once again, the principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied. The taxpayer is still footing the bill.	0.8008143086514319
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed, which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market.	0.8039541322553861
Strasbourg, 17 February" .	0.4565751173762552
We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region, we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed, emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe, and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability.	1.1792979342448038
This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote, because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate, to URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes.	0.8803941150569742
So who is this then?	0.46289851121461695
At the same time, it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada, which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India.	0.8526740793541286
It should continue along this path.	0.5821435658256067
Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States.	0.7723597679754745
Finally, if you asked me: What if there is no life out there among the stars, what if we are alone? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say: Do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly, before letting them go out to populate other planets?	1.2109485043191461
Mr President, I agree with the positive evaluation Mrs Junker has just made and I want to add that Mr Corrie has started his term as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation.	0.7202643865481544
How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office' s business abroad?	0.7948720867180972
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party.	1.06235657792368
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long.	0.8351688386703893
I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future.	1.0815819564925981
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.7638497095982528
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?	0.8085496886505696
Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House, namely to introduce such an area.	1.2689445630838692
What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today.	0.618391641339886
Despite their image of danger, derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance.	0.4824100122560489
Once again, the individuality, dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest.	0.6878573253087203
In this respect, what the Commission says about boosting Europe' s voice is important.	0.8331355640556909
Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty.	0.814162616732379
The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department.	0.6615260381052281
In any case, this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon.	0.7394920707168047
The purpose of the Commission's proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists.	0.9827046215546891
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see.	1.0449514005007157
The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9155181289257703
It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented, specifically by non-governmental organisations, but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters.	0.8603692239942199
We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe' s status in the international system.	1.0231897674810744
I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State.	0.5421400782734612
But, on the other hand, the wider view must also be taken, namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may, in the long term, lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account, and this will be of benefit to everyone.	1.0065638851815817
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.	1.0300779287119768
Europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom, including freedom to use one' s own money for the purposes of one' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will, others who make demands and then, when the break is made, refuse even to discuss the terms of the break, despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally.	0.876758758290757
Well, we cannot accept such statements.	1.177058542834751
I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs McNally' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women' s participation in professions in research and science, met with a fairly wide consensus.	0.8477309980301428
We need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted.	0.8424263483076272
Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water?	0.6948989531550638
Following the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new 'Culture 2000' framework programme.	0.7574008096494589
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women, of which I gave an initial evaluation, the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science, and the third involved Mr Kinnock, who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.	1.01514037087999
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available.	0.8401270320329992
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States' annual national plans for employment.	1.0084881927508158
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund.	1.0651377907669957
President of the Commission, a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans.	0.7817080558991832
The European information centres, which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting.	0.8234376374247833
On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did.	0.5847325764243482
We fully endorse the Community measures which were recommended in the Commission communication: advantageous taxation, that is, fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95% of which, I would point out, is made up of small and medium-sized businesses, which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European tourism sector; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the European Union, and therefore to investing in training; finally, it undertakes to make the job market transparent.	1.0626105328544053
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.	0.8125226231211685
We still await the first report, and that is why I believe this debate was premature, as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning.	1.3509283011106206
If we can eliminate the obstacles to make it cheaper to create new enterprises, to facilitate the access to financing and to change the attitude of society to be more positive entrepreneurship, I am sure the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from this.	1.1334622974002149
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament' s motions are anything to go by.	0.9913448416693655
But when it comes to aid, we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future, more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground.	0.8179616098111505
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy.	0.9673640157016842
Mr Jonckheer, I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union.	0.744871776414675
Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report.	0.9108842187221484
Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.	0.8920471773339701
It is practically certain that, with the raft of proposed measures and actions, it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12% renewable energy share by 2010, doubling the current rate, as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available.	0.8751511463946114
The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor.	1.1511018994108007
We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration.	0.46910852078465237
In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to.	0.8091365267395259
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions "outwards" , it also applies between the institutions.	1.0529820025653198
As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years, I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann.	0.890209082338522
We need more explanation of what Europe is about.	0.6611753553345641
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events.	1.00432732191649
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening.	0.9484162580425214
Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter?	0.6984505792171267
Mr President, I would very much just like to add to two particular points.	0.9906082020047067
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers.	0.9403665365819035
Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient.	0.6885523361642683
(SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference.	0.9426556240880569
Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?	0.6017658557387359
The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing.	1.0268316189522795
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.	0.6299614805772549
But under the influence of the free movement of employees, of the internal market and of the euro, the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated.	1.0843158977535035
Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda.	0.798153272203423
It worked for us.	0.2913836117641811
We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house.	0.7244816879677952
Ideally the European Parliament' s representatives should be able to support Cuba' s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing.	0.8787767446056914
We should not be too masochistic.	0.7847448209439901
It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP' s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations.	0.9697783201100385
Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility.	1.0377892649977376
But what we need is the analytical resources: these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital.	0.8528697263714192
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so.	0.9912338390798999
In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required.	0.7188447846999545
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer.	1.0206773530693114
The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government.	0.9235862778379614
The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited.	0.9035800988819455
We agree with many of the rapporteur' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission' s and the Council' s intentions and plans concerning social protection.	0.8610954463208097
Today we must give the green light to this conference, and, for its part, the Group of the European People' s Party, Mr President, is ready to give that green light.	0.9178398509655968
Thank you, Mr van Velzen.	1.1167287428818897
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned.	0.7128484115405757
According to the Commission, external policy can succeed, provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge!	0.8814267963162683
GMOs are the new challenge facing us.	0.6339671789355374
The President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion, namely to budget the European Development Fund.	0.8722020303215111
The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO.	0.8449253658783334
I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market.	0.7366314478634426
From the point of view of the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it.	1.323842820063563
Much, as Commissioner Patten said, remains to be done.	1.0532859173829208
In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.	0.7917508694481455
Madam President, I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, who took over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri.	0.9490793108280906
The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector.	0.9518909411145127
Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends.	0.9448171970864635
But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.	0.6308720028542655
Madam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House, but is also published on the Internet?	1.1207438376457934
- (DE) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the ÖVP and the FPÖ.	1.1469646291037046
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast.	0.8795535580553486
Since, in this case, transport costs are high, a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised, because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity.	1.0837415213855446
Question No 1 by (H-0022/00):	0.34009029273420066
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text.	0.8686476365225773
We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future.	1.052277312297867
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.	0.561641921590175
We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly.	0.49672444673489435
And yet, at the same time, we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines.	0.8939025829952789
A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively.	0.7860932650347526
The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed, in theory, to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market.	0.8926851784597496
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra.	0.8375763711234568
Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact?	0.42220747244247603
I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards.	0.45743388078509034
That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs.	0.7187097349314855
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure.	0.9008947642202318
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet, who is well versed in this matter, have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG, the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.	0.9338897365778877
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 2002.	1.0705415167170256
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product.	0.6069948862024199
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with 'communitisation' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe.	0.7332604681391638
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States.	0.7290473841985842
Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda.	0.8507519376409898
Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia' .	0.8985013428999508
In fact, we were shaken by it.	0.8562942828651137
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.	0.44414233557270655
Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration.	0.6879490869536847
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.	1.011998898983903
As for videoconferencing, more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded.	0.9348148473799398
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options.	0.9730771571698811
Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow.	0.621324339061927
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect.	1.0150334778384622
It therefore proved necessary, in the context of establishing the internal market, to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention.	0.9537023505416311
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material.	1.0719323229040187
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives.	0.9346887093517958
A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation.	0.7535668171446515
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR.	0.7447641903575264
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament, and that includes your proposal, and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it.	1.2900537830584435
Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union.	0.8978110873678672
Well in simple economic terms, Europe' s culture adds to genuine prosperity.	0.5158587538385787
Will you confirm what is the case?	0.8882330996873437
In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire.'	0.9590222829108752
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+.	0.9901877297720794
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?	0.5999581861897367
Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players.	0.8705846876698077
We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific 'nuclear research' context.	0.8642267911125857
We have seen vote after vote lost.	0.7318485197900406
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.	0.8641578349185173
The Council is minded to give priority to this area, within the Transport Council, and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible.	0.984559720484919
I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs.	0.678678408003545
As you know, both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately.	0.9830066460237505
The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one.	1.2000413376862629
In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.	0.6318469272459701
This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification.	0.5127779955894355
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.	0.6595186984540219
This precedent, created on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency, is a worrying one as far as the future of the European Union is concerned.	1.1104139742457162
This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998.	0.8604632273603171
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements.	0.7255983841980458
There is one thing, however, that we cannot deny, and that is that Mr Kouchner' s efforts to return Kosovo' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive.	1.0061081489511816
Mr Dupuis, first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word 'citizen' .	0.6026554527174748
Mr President, the various motions for resolutions tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East.	0.9755003965792102
As the smallest Community initiative in existence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected.	0.9402703994034117
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual.	0.6557143406453514
We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country.	0.6742503064700287
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community.	0.8097910567419455
In response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs McNally just now.	0.8223307335352789
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water?	0.5499865379500751
This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance.	1.3055642428658243
Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.	0.963311090180829
To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy, our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense, are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole.	1.0955200360199362
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions.	0.9406602791471376
Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state.	0.7011455910732598
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?	0.9546573057895835
Given the urgency surrounding this issue, has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud, in the Member States and in the European institutions, coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice?	0.9321542548614583
They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years.	0.5788040553859628
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM.	0.5713125592685149
In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property.	0.8011044570239164
The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea.	1.1217477111912182
Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.	0.6087642546179378
It does, however, support my view that I am not, apparently, the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion.	1.0205223901908784
I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity.	0.8519246101681475
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament.	0.7846694590807413
Allow me to say just one word. I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least, once it did, important decisions were taken straight away.	0.9303983401065583
The partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised.	0.8611412799659355
Social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists, thus creating an entire productive system.	0.8109767256727175
A communication later this year will give full details.	0.5185678884111585
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.41731908817767893
As a result, we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed.	1.0160905624487606
(The Minutes were approved)	0.14810573445767616
The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality.	0.608115839521027
And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.	1.1104210214448913
We are not, fortunately, at this point.	1.063575844478217
So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women.	0.8763152985792965
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community.	0.7391327139307482
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March.	0.5842098765687471
It is more a question of nine minutes, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects, not nine months.	0.8266227108742903
This is because the 15% increase is nominal and not real, granted that average yearly inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2%.	0.7962219948632143
I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that.	1.0561289660543165
She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation' s treaties.	0.7159192142357182
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways.	0.9180990928007272
Question No 41 by (H-0021/00):	0.27599057220864137
If this 'feedback' mechanism, which gives users the opportunity to make choices, were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it.	0.8633896241501591
Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants.	1.0102769876247255
It is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different Member States, such as specific climatic conditions, water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year, the social, economic and ecological effects of applying standards, and also of the failure to do so.	1.0161331871630002
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party, the French Communist mayors, were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France.	0.6732288619390093
Report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Sixth Periodic Report on the Social and Economic Situation and Development of the Regions of the European Union (SEC(1999)0066 - C5-0120/1999 - 1999/2123(COS))	0.7273931615718698
Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother.	1.0150319541565633
Until then, there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations.	0.7297793404523868
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment, ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening.	0.7661842402110145
I support this proposal for a resolution, especially the points which refer to the application of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the Structural Funds allocated and the fight against exclusion.	0.995952478026196
We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative, has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens.	0.996379616415922
One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect.	0.8943444835359
So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this.	0.7885681782477721
The President of Parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal, and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and I therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week.	1.2537739314834102
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions.	0.9452932847357945
In Agenda 2000, we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development.	0.9833044137181494
It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate, fair and transparent democratic debate, namely at national level in the main.	0.9926835426853963
Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security.	1.0051729885051133
Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.	0.9715899371298836
Furthermore, this means that we in the Council - and I think that Parliament will join us in this - should encourage the Commission' s involvement in this undertaking.	1.0533848328379547
It is, of course, a peace process which is finally under way.	0.6705256024980143
Secondly, the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited, as it is today, as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights, thereby denying the legitimacy and, if need be, the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect.	1.0258991349375708
We should be careful, though, Mr Prodi, because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission - precisely because, first and foremost, the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation, a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand.	1.0455470917827745
We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future.	0.6310716932902489
Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either?	0.9154795890208716
We hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned.	1.0653857107470077
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.	0.9581792453168426
The particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example, it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital, Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems.	0.8401699523758012
I would again thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter.	0.7283840746494742
In more general terms, this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants.	0.8115136339888531
The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans.	1.053803858829423
With this in mind, it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes.	0.733776984457518
On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting.	0.8624243482345405
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that.	0.8757059867176911
The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month.	0.8732789603522076
Despite everything, we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington.	1.21335255051196
Madam President, I would like, with reference to this report, to underline the problem of translation: reference should be made to the French or Italian version, since the text adopted by this Parliament will also be the authoritative one for the Commission.	1.1070351565649306
It is better firstly because the framework proposal made LIFE I more rigorous, more transparent and more rational.	0.8057224555606799
Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention.	0.7785868451078718
The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans.	1.1715347102393041
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.	0.6209753889304709
This is an irreparable loss.	0.7277473940091458
Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould.	1.0437708415740017
Mr President, allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation.	0.911306708048748
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy, as I did right from the moment I had my hearing, on 1 September, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.	1.0186755390725777
In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability.	0.8108003854214556
Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not.	1.1055094314887686
This will dramatically change the way it operates.	0.7220496513919488
The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003.	0.9645032916802682
From that standpoint, Aphrodite' s island, as Cyprus is known, and the pirates' island, as we islanders say of Malta with great affection, are two jewels which should be welcomed into the European Union without delay.	0.9245192899383209
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like my fellow MEP, Bartho Pronk, please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and, in particular, to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report.	1.0290946753749484
In this context, in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives.	0.8539988288163729
On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last.	1.134850066238151
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland, as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries.	0.9129097043014077
Indeed, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States.	1.0947108711491889
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward.	0.821840644480848
And this is not pure chance.	0.9405679190749247

Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, may have been a female model in Ancient Greece, but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace.	0.8022513865148403
In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here.	1.0949043720484486
On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.	0.9764104751573356
We need, in our judgement, to focus on a package of measures including: first, the introduction of effective, anti-discrimination legislation at Union level; second, implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non-Member States to promote, in practical terms, the integration of the immigrant population in Member States' societies; third, the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion.	0.9772381480898513
In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions.	1.063792004248784

Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive.	0.8509653161853236
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document.	0.5447202402874964
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred.	1.1810169458949094

Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition.	1.0019648975617348
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding.	1.0745968118592835
The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.	0.8189974547889105
In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, we wish, however, to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision.	0.9983966892299847
By equalising tariffs, i.e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them.	0.9462045431866568

You are unclear about this in your White Paper.	0.4652956617354901
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.	1.01886769644659
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.	1.024436875561733

The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations.	0.9298932110245561

Thank you for your reply.	0.47582698221999514
In addition, I should like to make a number of comments:	0.9245708730211799
Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another.	0.741741295745798
On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal, NATO is accused of 'serious violations of international humanitarian law' and 'wilful murder'.	0.8682664506246232
I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, "The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000" - you can see how topical this is - "the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present."	1.0115263713956575
We have established a new Directorate-General, yet it has only 70 people all told.	0.7463295565041783
The disease is always fatal.	0.42680985932481474
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.	1.0431672251921111
If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade.	1.029606409552755
Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.	1.273220692408705
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.04748144813222839
I cannot do anything about it myself, but you are quite right. We need a quick way of educating people, including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House.	1.2118188231268432
Nevertheless, the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence. This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted.	1.0265322617362282
By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence.	1.0116882331015575
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal.	0.4312634128629887
We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there.	0.5606335209054734
(Parliament rejected the proposal) President.	0.40583675811934244
Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly.	0.8169590845427875
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.	0.9709317409648309
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	0.7303934479300451
I will willingly accept Madam President' s apologies any time.	0.49508988165214207
In this first speech, I would like to share with Parliament the Commission' s view of the most important events in 1999.	0.9627979392624841
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that, despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code, the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code.	0.9040267733825338
For that reason, I approved these measures, but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enters our houses, to ensure that it is of the highest level.	1.0828591117474158
In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects.	0.9615338044329503
The President of the Council comes from a country, Portugal, which is directly at risk from just this type of situation.	0.9360999017753452
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come.	1.0202247467623957
I have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	0.5950032475845619
Certainly the Commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies.	0.7899422685998798
In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures.	0.9225033821704945
Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union. This in itself generates a large amount of waste.	0.8702788240759376

(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	0.6149372288026074
Mr President, this disaster at the mine in Romania affects a large hydrogeological area with rivers and watercourses in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria, The fact that 100 000 m3 of cyanide-poisoned water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come, as well as for animal and plant life, agriculture, the tourist industry, biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem.	0.926261756592298
One area though is extremely important, and this House must be involved in it: namely scrutiny.	1.1552154291334935
By that I mean the use, and often abuse, of embargoes during recent years, and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, where there have been human rights violations.	1.0591403733763611
I would be in favour of its doing so.	0.8556756916754593
Mr President, I do not think we are in a position to throw stones at the Eastern European countries which have come knocking at the door of the European Union, because ecological disasters occur as much here, in the west, as they do in the east.	1.075381553458862
But unfortunately, as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber, human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world.	0.966656419247382
I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State, with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter.	0.8537238129921538
Mr President, I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate, not just because development is in general an important issue, but because it is also a topical one.	1.292872664650818
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century.	0.7444452281564037
If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away.	0.7807824983234228
Furthermore, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which came to EUR 66.3 million in 1999.	0.956241527335378
Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.	0.9236770067353699
Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process, but I wish I could point to more real gains.	0.9826845706505852
Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months.	1.0647900224748814
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together, of innovation, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other.	0.8643100848715766
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall, over the whole Community fishing area.	0.8327736544209896

I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality.	1.1149991607716037
The EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created, whatever that may mean.	0.855457315893382
Another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails.	0.9506627130847176
Mrs Avilés-Perea, that was an exhortation rather than a question.	0.8941603419347282
For example, these would be measures for vocational training, for further education, for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process, for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements, in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.	0.9309039145555298
Within the framework of the action plan, each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures.	0.6834665661771192
The text therefore reads: 'instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation' .	0.4653936064409133
(The President declared the common position approved (as amended))	0.8285740863526939
No, you have not done so.	1.2472126899541263
This is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day?	0.937820754226901
Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power.	0.6938244132183523
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner.	0.9572624005150518
Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate.	0.8953443445354661
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind.	0.8401497096216475
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.	0.6833849120511934
I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish.	0.827952441656163
Quite, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying.	1.0593629237771693
What we have to do, and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources, and you are right, Mr Rübig, we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used.	1.2802339867052817
There is no reason why, against this background, we should agree to grant discharge.	0.959271688568154
But, in our view, that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced, either as regards the universality or, we hope, the quality of the basic social protection provided.	1.2239826993533065
Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.	1.1026864680247692
In this context of wholesale change, and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again, in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges, Europe needs to be economically strong, because globalisation demands unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too.	1.0200346992950902
"Condemns Mr Haider for his insults towards certain EU Member States and their leaders in the last few days in statements, which Foreign Minister Schüssel has failed to condemn."	0.8863971880975252
In fact, the same phenomenon occurs in tax law.	0.7993181886377279
But tomorrow will be too late.	0.38320084486279804
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.	0.9129116129581085
We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report.	1.0322537900711461
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe' s citizens.	0.7868577470869931
That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.	0.9899190855287325
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter, to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who, as things stand, have a right to this pension.	1.1659040480445508
The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups.	0.631836700977086
But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency.	0.9981406891653156
Take the fishing agreements, where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters.	0.9151656175655265
That concludes Questions to the Council.	0.6435882455592999
We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds. Instead, the focus should be upon preventing the real problem.	0.8754653288962517
Especially in the southern Member States, the tourist industry is a major source of income.	0.949282965973157
. I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate.	0.9473944845437495
The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council.	0.9806385505393457
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.	0.849218551750125
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate.	0.9662089680096079
Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs.	0.7778280704383107
In its proposal the Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER+ programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented.	0.640013880377994
It can hardly be because customers are satisfied.	0.4789213372573771
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.	1.0227406938141592
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.	1.0888291654975206
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?	0.7312657333810267
It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria.	0.76920029101792
These proposals favour women especially.	0.27921451751439785
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.	1.0223206258402164
On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided.	0.9949364143385757
As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality, at that time linked to the RECHAR funding.	0.6114066501030694
Therefore we need to have credibility, coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens.	0.9984297773392665
If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services.	0.8851702425502742
It does not matter what banner these come under because, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing.	0.8788799715819979
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!	0.9707307504959088
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today.	0.7434156832564218
There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.	1.0023470922308368
I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration.	1.0330099422687598
For these are prerequisite to any development.	0.4893398537019209
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture.	0.6866896934196258
Another important point is that we must do all we can, not just to prevent excessive deficits, but also to further reduce public deficits.	1.2550349084873629
(The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you.	0.7074608562793518
Question No 9 by (H-0044/00):	0.3489043116204754
"The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation, the more rules are needed", as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle.	0.8325352017953118
In fact, in my own constituency of Stockholm, we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies.	0.9041045310048728
There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries.	1.0234110319299954
But the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the Plumb/Delors Agreement.	0.5904155721794773
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you.	1.081735765892366
Ladies and gentlemen, the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events: the first was the election of the President of Finland, Mrs Halïnen.	1.1309413473993049
The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200.	0.45290027335409605
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.	1.1913497327649925
The Commission?	-0.0
The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today.	0.8348956321467098
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions.	0.7910429632790856
This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.	1.2785691920695275
Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.	0.8387618272872778
On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation.	0.8605853069607787
I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	0.8670624223202661
The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive.	0.2669277456311727
Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.	0.6308828362823476
My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise.	1.1248827736554499
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately.	0.9568149669616377
I refer to point 9.	0.5862615494497896
Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much.	1.169275680206711
I, together with the European Parliament' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view, as expressed in the report produced by the Council' s Legal Service, is inappropriate.	1.0309275856031603
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament, a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission.	0.9356815978232826
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	0.8117208679035286
In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union?	1.0003072579383971
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report.	0.8738149634482192
Mr President, from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds, but only 5¾ % is set aside for the Community initiatives, INTERREG, LEADER, URBAN and EQUAL.	1.0479428901588537
It also contains four calls to the Member States which highlight the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities and the establishment of measures favourable to tourist-oriented SMEs, particularly in the tax sector and in access to financial instruments. These would encourage the growth of employment in sectors which use labour intensively, such as the tourist sector.	0.9054859778659612
Mr President, for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money.	0.8718023711961671
First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive.	0.9960613705482226
It is the international community, and specifically the United Nations, which should be held responsible for implementing Resolution 12/99 and, in particular, for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality.	1.1504546086568952
But it is also a very vulnerable sector, as we recently saw with the oil slick.	1.2016988515280036
In this document, the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe.	0.8558010307344536
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy.	0.7271648604569337
Mr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe.	0.621867563210796
First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers.	1.0262571367281894
Commissioner, it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform.	0.9107902832711169
The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions.	0.7468357104334199
We need structural reforms in the European economy.	1.0917856089397178
There is no other such policy.	0.7005299188082601
A sound alternative would be to clean the ship' s sides mechanically.	0.6201248175075693
The problem for some of us, however, is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity.	0.841490483670769
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa, Schengen, Eurodac etc. Any democrat can spot two key problems.	0.6110409586756559
Social policy must facilitate employment, creating incentives for employers and employees to, respectively, provide and accept jobs.	0.7570214149437511
Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government?	0.9360045709662627
That concludes the debate.	0.20207446134964485
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents, yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity.	1.0348268596609906
The story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that, because he was Austrian, he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries, including Denmark.	0.9240361642036523
This is not the usual state of affairs.	0.8849912378161691
There are only a few weeks to go before the elections.	0.9309105383869737
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness.	0.4792718341217438
Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti.	0.9290024504511023
We want more than that, however.	1.069604824638442
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.	0.9167283671855201
At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably, now standing at 71.	0.728788333721534
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong, especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union, then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another.	1.1120281954811149
That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support.	0.8202389999709584
It should prevent society from splintering.	0.49545899897057705
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.	0.76026503828895
We have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection.	0.6918516269007596
This effort was appreciated, even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals, and moreover, Mr President-in-Office, you also expressed different views.	0.9843681190014142
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.	0.8541679542772131
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation.	0.6185125734584218
Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.	1.0165961651139108
It is still not an insurmountable problem.	0.8762884969310887
Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear.	0.8452869501287794
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is.	0.44053175400562117
At the same time, however, it means that both the Council and the Commission have a very strong mandate, so that the strength of opinion expressed by all the European parties, and all the peoples, can empower their political ability to address the problem.	1.110651655343709
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent.	0.7198687165373183
Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty.	0.9023913604062698
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2.	0.580149563331256
Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration.	1.1148100125551055
We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament.	1.0327553152898787
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees.	0.48653758618579074
He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity.	1.0636570655902642
The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63, 69, 73, 79, 86, 89, 96, 99, 106 and 108.	0.5334766086454461
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	0.9290189193351239
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House.	0.917230674720295
In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated.	0.7926293776755968
The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly.	0.6226147265285737
We have enough agreements; they just need to be implemented.	0.780468375259733
It must be visible.	0.565474280111959
It also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation, which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States.	0.8066599863169283
(FR) Here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation.	0.6212301664205803
Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society?	0.9735635452565565
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services.	0.8510827756152551
So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same.	1.0507504687099292
Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits.	0.5857606062728162
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned.	0.7450005895583116
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.	0.910508381056069
The next item is the joint debate on:	0.5451411110740173
Important progress has been made, and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions.	0.7548069345021473
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives.	0.5842783683742961
There was no majority for this at the time.	0.7942369500844235
Mr President, rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area, and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Fischler.	1.1866462172517367
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight' s debate.	0.7644030927454638
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.	0.8604238848634814
We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them, but we are choosing not to use them.	0.9046233108936836
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT.	0.582095030705635
It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government, as well as his own work, although it was irrelevant to that event.	0.9477382220453442
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market, to stabilise confidence in this market, to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety.	1.0845485507161172
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently, more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.	1.1698134350780227
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well?	0.6248393188329074
In this way, at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations, a shot in the arm.	1.014530686024014
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises.	0.8537677486476475
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough.	1.0381896597721245
Thank you, too, those who contributed to this matter' s being dealt with swiftly. I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.	0.8387535694480923
Then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well.	1.0216281608310582

Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.	0.7756482538653862
. I accept that.	1.0992665549045064
According to the Treaty, one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language.	0.7535180769492422
They have paid already.	0.2896436811108141
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential.	0.5903888901023168
The present agreement is a kind of pre-pre-agreement, but with a view to joining in future.	0.7822002080852217
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.	0.6654572845721791
I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning, a concern to which I devote myself, that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate, my concern, as I said, that, apart from the URBAN initiative, urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them, beyond the scope of URBAN, in all structural fund programming.	1.00537207042364
And finally, in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change, the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance.	0.9323187945345659
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system?	1.0452720446002977
Statement by the President	0.3353440263204474
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.	0.9505960956075081
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which, if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol, is the important factor.	0.8913441464543204
Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible.	1.3268336402710217
The seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention.	0.692919524710402
All who are in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion: it is a tragic, desperate situation where there is a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side. Mitrovica is a tragic example of this.	0.9128901371999532
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK.	0.8567347615133901
As I have said, numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - I am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team.	1.030704968910827
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.	0.7442368200822695
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system.	0.9209315471399223
I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction, towards European exclusiveness and apartheid.	0.8223736778627527
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business.	0.8050279148972953
It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on.	0.9875792552637831
As a result, the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded, not even in a bad economic climate.	0.8731848576728818
Which Commissioners are members of this group?	0.8580865069742449
We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States.	0.9202944424067281
As far as Cyprus is concerned, although the Council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. It also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition, which I welcome.	0.9165842936222244
Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit, which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members, assisted in providing early information, analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves?	1.0218547791759567
In that sense, we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law.	0.8776190895567247
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to focus on the point of internal reform.	0.7444773683231527
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources.	0.746068785120096
However, there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south, specifically Amendment No 43 which, with regard to the recuperation of costs, also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making.	0.9944595059037176
Why not?	-0.0
We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism' s contribution to job creation.	0.7454775060076893

Mr Solana, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall limit my speech to those subjects.	1.0038357121304977
The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets.	1.1184970679147441
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the view of the Greek Communist Party is that the main problem of Cyprus is not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of 40% of its territory by Turkey, which has continued for 26 years.	0.9374136683079155
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too, provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established.	0.9099699223181116
The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history.	1.0914617710923555
I know it takes longer, but should we not always have a show of hands first?	1.0250137105311423
Nevertheless, we must look at this resolution, and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because, as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world, we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process, and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future.	1.2569874701941195
The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.	1.0017870833206026
In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion.	0.9721676739809353
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges, but at the moment, the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned.	1.0431932965885828
I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union.	1.2154691098605372
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems, who see, in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity.	1.054530803224568
We need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Europe as well.	0.888326659001076
This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches.	0.7571323144143505
There are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions, because the point of departure is, of course, that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern.	0.9711090439676922
As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics, it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out.	0.802195811663836
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.	0.7632366759655791
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally.	0.4454157515395169
Sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist.	0.8596164236814847
Commissioner, thank you for your answer. However, I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled 'International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor' .	0.9621370602997845
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel, there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament's next part-session.	0.9203993047647168
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process.	0.884480314507814

Other issues have been mentioned: cattle-farming in Namibia, tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean.	0.5300767607302784
Finally, I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation.	0.895193044495538
Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage.	0.6391982674680652
I have good reason for asking this.	0.5251094753819441
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent.	0.561807547783664
For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country' s approval.	0.8665679523746399
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.	0.5827965504277892
I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality, but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples' lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold, colourless, artificial neon bulbs in our lamps, which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium.	0.8684434711298397
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality, which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry.	1.0507280084686825
This is the best support we can give to European democracy.	0.9612894451487151
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45.	0.9050302413109432
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.	0.8643374123845436
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic.	0.8352227540850429
Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs.	1.080867214098103
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance, and that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up.	0.918556792219017
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located.	0.7230601204310454
We shall now proceed to the vote.	0.24815817334424106
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development, job creation and, more particularly, on equal opportunities and transport issues.	0.9831526197393425
This brings home the connections which bind us together.	0.33418192503987443
Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed.	1.1461350378360593
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)?	0.7809651690656998
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget, the allocation of funds that is, into the different types of measure.	0.7800343077867681
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens' indifference to Europe.	0.69482904438378
At this stage, the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position.	1.0194182394873808
No, we should continue to make progress by working discreetly to support the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with his remit.	0.920558478076654
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.	1.1968722844253403
Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House.	0.8561274452027219
It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play, and not to play, with regard to social security.	1.1138306532520248
Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO.	0.851290003942331
Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born.	0.8308910939229438
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	1.134825895824463
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again.	0.5309545297336722
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this.	0.8002930783865394
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio' s Amendment No 22 in both respects.	1.0942526234706185
Cultural policy means, in particular, defending the role of the arts, recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards.	0.7112807668179437
A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40% for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes.	0.6532490161774659
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens' concerns about food safety issues to the fore.	0.6491289585002495
In view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report, and I have therefore voted in favour of it.	0.9592439272934523
We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one.	1.0312119602547234
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.	1.121235097717984
It also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant States.	0.75538063799887
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.	0.9104364280779909

The fact that the Council' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group.	0.8918538272731142
But the world of international finance is a dangerous one.	0.7900007629153017
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council.	0.8816800588584678

But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.	0.9034681472888493
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government.	0.6605225517550468
This is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union, in other words the Commission and also the Council, can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation.	1.170945183398463
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest, which clearly there is not in this case.	0.9083658610851296
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital.	0.8315586632191345
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.	0.8056594299005939
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.	0.4480185638672478
Both myself, as rapporteur, and the committee think we ought to say yes.	1.2069401059174436
However, there is a current trend - the "fauna, flora, habitat" directive was quoted as an example - which, in my country at least, creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the European Union.	0.8692195812546022
According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.	0.8612387120811346
In the same way, through the LEADER initiative, structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas.	0.8331753306213334
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this.	0.546448828710642
They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with.	1.1959313972264445
I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between.	1.1073805275265558
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.	0.7597542302258754

We are taking legal advice.	0.5584320283915911
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may.	0.9210668816582608
On Mrs Isler Béguin' s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community' s priorities during the previous programming period.	0.9383039494913319
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country.	0.973265539491677
I must say that Alex Langer's presence here in the European Parliament is sadly missed. His efforts to build peace should serve as an example, to all of us, on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved.	1.088344582748384
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed, provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity.	1.021926404574785
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	0.8776127932357205
The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977.	0.6870454422204534
I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency' s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March.	0.8034142347444362

Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms.	0.9841527553148179
It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.	0.9494337006529844
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers.	0.5829024061928597
Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms.	0.7880306396228439
Now it is freedom, security and justice, and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security, important as it is, above the equally important needs of freedom and justice.	0.8137647461074847
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe.	0.5936492085341595
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?	0.7070854651971317
The car lobby was unsuccessful today and I am pleased about that.	0.9127192438303832
We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive.	0.8765656759208023
The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another.	0.8224131713063424
The antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain.	0.6744697198442221
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)	0.5113415260196885
In Italy, we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars, but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy.	0.8271030236513777
The maritime world has great potential.	0.44552622045176854
The European Union' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion.	0.9157634299930135
But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy.	1.3372821563705999
By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors.	0.9341579708690868
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is, so to speak, ambiguous and unique?	1.0209183120684608
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.	0.7698349551594804
Finally, I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use.	1.1190602552946993
. (DA) The Left' s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that, with today' s decision, Parliament has NOT supported the fourteen prime ministers' diplomatic sanctions against Austria.	0.9845384044837422
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.	0.7810934084590166
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which appropriately reflects the tenor of the debates in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chaired.	0.965419659059931
All this is to the good of the consumer.	1.0853645941910408
We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening, and to tell the military and the police what they must do, otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence.	1.0143971256066435
Subsidies distort allocations, both within and between countries.	0.9458238315947955
In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter.	0.7222053848076914
However, justice delayed is justice denied, and we must reflect on this notion.	1.09495792281105
Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power.	0.9273678116725115
Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this.	0.9628472738760108
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point.	1.2712505140160435
Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.	1.0474095625884061
The Commission points out that, according to the national legislation of some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised.	0.7956651949488188
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery.	0.4629218559196149
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.	0.6431061592209056
In other words, whenever I get the chance, I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text.	0.825237454265205
It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself.	0.8538408302068841
This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission, and not by the Commission on its own. In most countries where the Commission is active, development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves.	1.222248968105722
We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure.	1.0240560151035236
At the same time, the social and economic problems facing European society are more pronounced in urban areas.	0.8483360540611313
Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations?	0.9341222014855467
The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.	1.2423214095365842
In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.	1.0492733414496356
That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal.	0.9265627283597169
Such a European strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, notably through new technologies; training in order to upgrade skills, quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism.	0.9785625632227901
Mr President, a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service.	1.0811647640881117
Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists.	0.8678135946600662
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one.	0.9883288412087028
On this specific point, we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction.	0.7883522734448967
We are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is to construct the European passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even-handedly across the board.	0.872840117372082
Where, above all, will the required money come from, and where should this observatory be located?	0.8055845632149791
We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers.	1.1886278897765798
What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference?	0.7229145397947196
We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda. They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered, and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament' s participation in it.	1.0256708621512218
We wholeheartedly support, at national level, many of the ideas presented in Mr Andersson' s report.	1.0206942221309092
But we see no reason to lower our guard.	0.5847800225445436
To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal.	0.6840832297234443

Questions to Mr Nielson, who is replaced by Mr Patten	0.7504099395450676
It is therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the EQUAL programme.	0.976949470991576
Our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective, not merely within the European Union, but also at world level, given the increasing globalisation of the economy.	1.1170152298360438
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together.	0.5844555123247579
The other issue is access to confidential documents.	0.43507506632938553
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach".	0.8410417185074197
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.	0.9641230178835859
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary.	0.5700738924422043
I must take this opportunity to say that it is precisely the amendment submitted by the European Parliament that is so important to me in this respect.	1.2347704023593806
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union.	0.6999953725574655

I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue.	0.8013657028979057
Report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection (COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS))	0.7111491276681529
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few.	0.5928096107569265
I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence.	0.6141858212803538
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market.	0.8764158625668763
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example.	0.921219253997229
President.	-0.0
Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance, if you will, that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue.	1.0342028591119141
Both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson, it is emphasised that it is the Member States which have responsibility for and, therefore, also determine the content of, social security arrangements.	1.2899189644502738
We all know what we would do, which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy.	1.1042595146813499
I believe that today' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors.	1.0692757933703911
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration.	1.0266975621928378
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.	0.9993993890821765
This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.	1.2057165187494208
Will the Commission remain silent?	0.6569395300588037
In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid.	0.7519166973558831
This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.	0.8635944009283018
Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy, I question whether today is the time to be holding it.	1.0475818145588187
It is better to do it absolutely properly.	0.7877788485497711
We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found.	1.1247901420928497
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%.	1.0196686492629203
Current programmes must be accelerated.	0.2882641775059393
He is not stupid. Certainly not!	0.6007034789280381
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future.	0.628738536795419
Can you please do something about it?	0.5991280013257212
Behind these principles, Mr President, lies the justice system.	0.7125070481896463
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency.	0.9744624584936419
Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service.	0.535051294969485
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to, and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible.	0.917310368052592
There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports.	0.648222619320222
I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance.	1.0465404822681585
Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50% of companies' turnover.	0.6629341280629966
The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available.	1.1096041147209963
This is also the case for the so-called statutory government which is just as guilty, because if this journalist has accused the President himself of deriving benefit from this civil war, then all he is doing is voicing what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across Africa.	0.8981697653892408
So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality.	1.134523189513109
Yet, all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies.	0.7062145374286439
Mr President, I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture.	0.7854539120982402
The second point is the enlargement of the Union.	0.817365652225249
Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters, but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks.	0.7598782133422627
It is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100% public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership, even under cover of environmental protection.	0.7326349481753441
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.	0.9608272402098953
We think that the role of food safety, specifically in terms of everything linked to public health, is one of our presidency' s essential tasks. It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme.	1.0715030726618366
Collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital. In this respect, the action plans approved by the High Level Group and the Tampere European Council must be allocated a budget.	1.0348424020393316
However, we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water, granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers.	0.9943685759886047
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up.	0.5955192911712388
After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion. For this reason, modernisation was essential.	0.8410671975615224
How do you think a system like that would affect people' s confidence in ourselves as politicians?	0.5589525069135075
We must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to Europe' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact, about forty years.	0.9970345582518656
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration.	0.7899038263376477
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.	0.3929398625280393
As regards the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made its financial proposal.	1.0922443793410146
But this new course of action is very exciting.	0.5851251902598529
(Applause)	-0.0
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted, which is a pity.	0.9824213562720863
Our concern and our ambition, therefore, on a large number of subjects, is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully.	1.0117566376800482
I cannot shake off the impression that, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency. This is something which I very much regret.	0.9382073827499253
This motion asks the Commission to present a report to Parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax. It also asks for an examination of the pressures and financial sanctions which could be applied against countries which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax havens.	0.8175556353834061
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers!	0.6634505744574426
These days, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable.	0.6206390959315782
For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies.	1.017682103586889
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which, when taken together, form a real alternative resolution.	0.7169920801737597
That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings.	0.35692864424486
Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions.	0.7107128670724331
This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it.	0.7532899394691932
This highlights the need for something which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time, namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type.	0.7890620284297779
Will the Commission present new initiatives in order to see whether, through the constant efforts of the Commission and Parliament, we can gradually convince the Council to do something on this issue?	1.3637000449138759
What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other, they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow?	0.925178787389731
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world.	0.8621089027179522
Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny.	1.1036930458078644
But we need that reform process.	0.7885803834939071
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.	0.9134464549432352
The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure.	0.8134090577297451
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals.	1.1510992958405595
The first is greater transparency.	0.8899023741246914
Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States?	0.8904316793267683
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management.	1.0743494625848733
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one. As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles.	0.9666928727383042
The successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above.	0.7263874450334202
We need bold change and, at the same time, we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States.	0.9076625876566591
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union' s institutions.	0.7666554444639344
It is important to point this out.	0.7154637865497804
As an MEP from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest.	1.0254631648868167
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear.	0.5704942090346392
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Böge' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament' s temporary BSE Committee.	0.8726088232764917
Nonetheless, as far as the divided island of Cyprus is concerned, overall, this pre-accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge.	1.0561323091016375
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties.	0.6521808264157261
The stronger the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.	0.8615583338637374
In September, we undertook to present a White Paper on reform, and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence.	1.0192261360098376
Finally, I should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy.	0.7694927347493503
In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos.	1.017465149327978
Sadly, in this case, he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring.	1.0225069309143093
How have these been organised by Mr Solana' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission?	0.6905373665699617
This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured.	0.5149041607025685
But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit, and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes, indeed, but changes which have only made poverty worse.	0.7733381032379538
All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole.	0.8338028920752584
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?	0.9114624030236091
Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation.	1.019200316925126
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved.	0.6706149957139373
A study has shown that 90% of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10% between individuals.	0.7998377118860073
So much for the political aspect.	0.5421274403597899
To give a non-contentious example, no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons.	0.8626969103564859
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council.	1.0215966442992612
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission.	0.7765286808674176
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.	0.9768235229660732
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on, it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts.	1.0988485419573766
I did not defend attacks on civilians.	0.42242108314038335
We are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 March 2000 of the Association Agreement between Morocco and the European Union.	0.7808328686601383
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete.	0.7473121391117578
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	1.0189897649527104
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed.	0.6666223371740782
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance, and that they should be given one more référendaire.	1.0604753994619063
This Chamber was not made for goods, it was not made for money.	0.9059276621982841
But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.	0.7423047197871009
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	0.9630172686521203
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.	0.9188652195306846
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union.	0.958369657560934
It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law.	1.0597718382729522
With this, we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed.	1.190558266701786
The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999, and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination, notably in the fields of peace building, food safety, fisheries and migration.	0.8682197366282572
Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union?	0.9968440041627527
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.	1.0956197711899907
Middle East peace process (continuation)	0.4526929269075421
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9849298779597581
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things.	0.6598819600773962
The first concerns this Parliament.	0.5569775112221913
Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter?	1.1077180992132525
In the measures that have been adopted, I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted. I trust that this will be remedied in the future.	1.1114844484806203
However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you.	1.0624213344150206
The topic touches the very core of the European Union.	0.6184594043677516
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan.	0.4366761578878934
The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States' government deficits.	0.8067711816860652
In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred.	1.0561138551630362
(Applause)	-0.0
Question No 4 by (H-0028/00):	0.4269009987458535
A list has been compiled, containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment.	0.5628832030497137
They must, however, not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy, but must develop their own self-sufficient role.	1.103304475343382
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people' s health and the ecosystems.	0.6416535009599159
So what should we do?	0.6052253915765066
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement.	0.8034109510518314
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together, under your guidance particularly, in the course of these few months, which is extremely important.	1.01707921514456
Pensions: The document states that, 'Member States must remain responsible for modernising social protection systems' , and yet the Commission itself intervened in the case of Italy, repeatedly calling for swift changes to the pension system to reduce rights and decrease pension payments.	0.9049035925659183
Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way.	0.9167433968900979
It is obvious, however, that these countries, impoverished within a Communist economic system, cannot cope with a social policy like, for example, Sweden' s.	0.9054639786542518
This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and, not least, to our descendants.	0.9235288655229134
From that standpoint, the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us, any State, any policy or any view, impel that small republic towards external, disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems, granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy.	0.790983259432528
In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role.	0.9282709047295091
As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.	1.1716207534086212
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	0.43421780161254997
These would, of course, be to the advantage of modern, progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms.	0.7361345967040026
Key stakeholders, including consumers, are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests.	0.7059259369003228
On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.	1.0893619453771606
I worked for many years on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open, European-style, pluralistic democratic society.	0.7049155936211425
It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles.	0.8259681421151608
It is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are, irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse.	0.7876697129343172
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.	1.1671544725126473
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Britain, to remove the retrospective nature of this measure.	0.7057137237698846
In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds.	1.0795454780482863
The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.	0.7283089820922896
In France, in particular, we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions.	0.7534482388444556
. Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries.	0.8526056897985599
I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits, the positive aspects of competition.	0.9562363923442698
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.	1.1018555664832597
Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously.	0.8958735983380604
Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom.	1.084486116019635
We have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine, in Moldova, the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks, the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks, the political consequences of dealing with those stocks.	0.9726667503801496
We cannot afford to waste time.	0.3619922541668098
I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this.	0.9475003229939657
By contrast, I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino, as has consistently been the case since his appointment. This leads me to another point.	0.9394443570097397
Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes.	0.8884646920199749
This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.	1.2211034460341028
The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements.	1.034993609495221
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system.	0.8128615262737829
Both in Rwanda and Kosovo, the UN, despite the many warnings, appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres, as President Havel pointed out this afternoon.	0.8084326748433566
Vote	-0.0
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.	0.7927332849807246
Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed.	0.9848931777343373
Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris.	0.7373453331543199
We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees.	0.8899905751646422
This will be the only way for the Cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace.	1.0602087742547213
I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers.	1.0300595413027964
And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded.	0.8256575387417359
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.	1.0894890843905334
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar, but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner' s outstanding bills.	0.9135711375876039
Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened.	0.8662564475353679
The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater, the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals, which we all need in society in all circumstances, should not be finding their way into our water system.	0.8976786974964382
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.	1.0526257514852655
Mr President, today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony.	0.799566874237056
Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage.	0.8674661994354615
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.	0.7049786651775577
Perhaps 'redundant' is the most serious epithet, and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament.	1.2054594113342874
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular, in the form of a new version - LEADER+ - is therefore greatly to be welcomed.	1.0421932673182277
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities.	0.6877711314881374
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.	0.5631148196671152
(FR) Mr President, we have already had the opportunity, at the first reading, to examine this report and I was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this House.	1.174240132592606
Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission's determination to make progress serves as a model.	0.976338503899142
It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday.	0.6998638028645323
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.	0.7245482151038369
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament' s modus operandi.	0.9106828194394265
After all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about, and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position.	1.3207721750264745
The debate is closed.	0.15965829092981487
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.	1.0250422236995587
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water.	0.9751127907871796
However, I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations.	0.986195902057422
It was erroneously included in today' s agenda.	0.513837631600807
This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control.	0.57288040535396
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.	0.5038976862186577
Coordination is the key word here.	0.6534686679977175
The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives.	0.48582861512527853
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries.	0.7889420678743894
With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika' s owners?	0.9290721457413785
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation.	1.1316313439482888
They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM.	0.6839086817622863
Please excuse this very legal answer.	0.4016586868019928
It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty.	0.5725593879385846
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime.	0.7672330216313149
Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model.	0.7519578201267996
Mr President, sadly, the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one.	0.8692418289752526
Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session.	0.8601623053235964
Talks in Austria on forming a government	0.22815020817352594
However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.	0.9517000435788027
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF.	0.7872684913085708
We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the "them and us" syndrome.	0.6361135330036676
Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the social areas to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention.	1.0698044949663355
. (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union.	1.1058605849574452
I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side!	0.910604301581401
Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with.	0.8632019513845957
Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication.	1.0938710726666019
It also, of course, finds indirect expression in the question.	0.5557617625851974
Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection.	0.6716585458425808
However, in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, by virtue of the programme' s content, to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, this sector become subject to codecision.	1.1586869101924464
The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is, however, in addition to this recommendation, dependent on implementation by the parties themselves.	0.858926987282157
On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties, consumers and workers.	0.8242813289194504
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann' s work on this matter.	0.7501020988360947
I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment.	0.49117299122998775
Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.	1.0428306985087543
I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourrière, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work.	1.0420015191738592
Firstly, there is the regional approach.	1.1222888578989898
Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management.	0.8121082668827703
This is one of the aims that LIFE-Environment must achieve. Thirdly, the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment' s priorities is an extremely positive step.	1.045296134639507
In spite of the fact that, both in the Treaty and at the UN' s meetings in Rio and Copenhagen, there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world, the budget for development aid is, in actual fact, being cut back, when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen.	1.0834408209513606
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration.	0.6122050729393296
Increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro	0.46662992075974874
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect.	0.8151377267578397
Finally, the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities.	0.9063429023100726
My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people, businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition.	0.7919565953906363
In fact, competition policy and consumer policy belong together.	0.9217073277505838
In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one.	0.9408560937107054
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.	0.8711410963359664
The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate.	1.362462138390998
The cost of maintaining the environment, which we all enjoy, must be met by all of us, and the LIFE programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective.	1.0610583149574573
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom.	0.8811838118067313
ETA must be condemned. However, those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned.	0.7308292781433621
I also want to mention the death penalty.	0.7224876730626566
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around?	0.8858033011442419
Without agriculture, the rural world will disappear.	0.8474518725328141
We all know that, in 1995, it was agreed that the Union' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law.	1.1117655813060254
However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support.	1.0957598027360975
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled.	0.5411231923903705
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today.	0.9123828342468141
This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully.	0.8342367104763526
In the meantime, the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist.	0.668642084947338
The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry.	0.6034987802570089
It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems.	0.9286182603578704
However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead!	0.8627090746356796
But in that case, not only Sweden, but all EU countries, should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol.	1.0567591256118425
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point.	0.46676024473642463
I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon.	0.8549817265536006
We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident.	0.896810378891774
Rather, the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me.	0.6654584662053871
It is important for us to remember that this is a framework.	1.1529000645370193
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations.	0.9514061466509592
As regards our external partners, all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes.	0.8648547306320967
This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist.	0.8952984674905655
As Mr Barnier too pointed out, it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission' s staff.	0.8897972211852819
The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden.	0.7442531866810045
What should this global actor' s objective be?	0.5790598099244629
Dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000, the date promised by Ehud Barak?	0.7804459710524929
We must bring these reservoirs under Community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again.	0.8467013370970232
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead.	1.0669740452337062
And why should we not note that the Commission' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes?	1.1056668222059993
This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament.	1.1281625775317428
Nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague, all too pie in the sky.	0.8905885350086382
Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned.	0.9651240605804663
Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology.	0.7589086166356407
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical.	0.8483501412017995
Report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD))	0.5867433750065423
However, it has now achieved notoriety.	1.2365224295357085
I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia.	0.6253904366643948
I have some sympathy with the Commission's standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally.	0.8938286119906557
I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement.	0.9546261942869843
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.7335713942796467
The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences.	0.8216923151818989
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question.	1.0276525498320919
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.	1.1055876448810806
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines.	1.031411471882491
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.	1.0129250739268565
For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest.	0.8386917976600395
Would it be possible for the EU to create a standardised inspection system that would also guarantee payment, out of Community funds, for the inspection of ships that fly a flag of convenience and cannot themselves pay the cost?	0.8991825220947604
Actually, I hear less and less about this.	0.959783596299022
It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States.	0.7931008196010372
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers.	0.6821375268212484
Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki?	0.8568355440319944
It is for the public, therefore, that we are developing the area of freedom, security and justice.	0.9215820418811032
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"	0.8291247592127604
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities, and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves.	0.9806400845278371
It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report.	0.7926453844867437
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment.	0.9556411159778117
Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.	0.902959180415182
A number of technical provisions need to be made, such as the installation of a computer network, archives, a canteen and furniture.	0.8912784705164447

If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision?	0.934524218145966
The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive.	0.8399187989538408
In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244.	0.6758259600932796
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace.	0.48463743279480925

You founded and signed Charter 77, the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people.	0.6126295888865949
Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.	0.9969047063830262
I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights.	0.8780901191709598
At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of.	0.8815389420623956
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary.	0.5529336673461818
That is a sensible forecast to make, it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain.	1.2050645044593908

Unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection, there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years, and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies.	0.8914829813620309
However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here.	1.0884042767900954

We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider.	0.570611803000635
Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world.	1.2947743191486738
One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food.	1.1085028923397293
The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration.	0.8529118527603607
To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East.	0.6768767104783903
(FR) In its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, the Commission repeats that Europe needs to become a 'global actor' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world.	0.8013953109718753
Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening.	1.0338514310435978
We could not agree with a proposal like this, which challenged the authority of the European Parliament.	1.0359338139276113
We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994.	0.8347857924169172
The information that I have is to do with the 1995 directive, which does not include any provisions of that kind.	1.0245177024260956
It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam.	0.8989765213095243

I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances.	0.4699174812950369
Mr President, the Council and, I think, the Portuguese Presidency in particular, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas.	1.1468963258072358
Firstly, the whole system is obscure.	1.176225452445235
That will require a new political culture, not only in words, but also in practice, which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions.	1.3303898238419545
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state.	0.9074379093723096
We must clearly set firm objectives.	0.6197637556665337
So that is at least a step forward.	0.9804984069713939
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict.	0.7894376111008334
There are also courts in Karlsruhe, London, Lisbon, Dublin and Edinburgh.	0.5731786478902021
You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops.	0.4201373349701694
I hope that the accession money available to assist Cyprus is used partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuilding of trust and that both sides of the divided communities in Cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it is given.	0.7592392847176074
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined.	0.9792661361550584
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.	1.0437364934984776
We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements.	0.9676015852219925
You are looking to reassure the acceding countries, as well as European opinion.	0.7464482126200065

The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B. It bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period.	0.7146068810649483
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.	1.1153579265524312
However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.	1.0633469079988784
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge.	0.9665176044159128

On the basis of this principle, human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves.	0.9635715093453047
There are certain other key issues: relations with Ukraine, relations with Russia, relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly, the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history, and for security and peace in Europe for future generations. In this regard, we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa.	1.0381926261273322
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars.	0.5767864746098889
This is positive because, in that way, the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately, and this will benefit us all.	0.9199656168976006
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off.	0.45567943336146655
The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo.	1.0752915156784246
I can testify to this remarkable work.	0.3521488709240933

The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries, mainly through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.	0.9642480327208706
Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely.	0.46801704061832655
History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation.	0.5146124146500758
This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort.	0.9462340644029441
It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State.	0.7942204357354676
I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries: dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica.	0.5625549910108992
Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action?	1.0966509477481619
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.	1.0474283724176736
Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along, namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars, paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government.	0.6890239451869875
The postal service is not just for Christmas.	1.1363795760411477
In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail.	1.0382439312178058
This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo.	1.0853903387852148
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity.	0.983605323560216
Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs.	0.7286891882827099
At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union.	1.1328194219874554
As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans.	0.9511118241953932
It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation.	1.2148279202545167
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory.	0.44951006683794514
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.	1.3641800741727819

Firstly the agreement on political issues.	0.5972419749085575
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.	1.140794912567646
For all these reasons I thought it essential to reply directly to Mr Van Hecke' s question on this issue.	0.8973530750801886

I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions.	0.6825299423886962
But is Commissioner Vitorino aware, not only of Mr Haider's and the Freedom Party's words, but also of their deeds?	1.0709779551070064
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.	0.7929135662097385

We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved.	0.8546313467663917
A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost.	0.6285200037580432
Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important.	1.0623811757620722
In other words, once this study is complete, the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible.	0.885626866777303
Thank you, Mrs Banotti, and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this.	1.0245951783868286
And yet, we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.	0.7887400163606852
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time.	0.9120483181019863
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.	1.1769822342563843
Consequently, if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future, in light of the economic and employment changes taking place, as well as the requirements of society, modernisation is absolutely essential.	1.0172784799150354
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated.	0.4540458592834621
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind, whatever name it goes by, will be given influence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matters, and who will issue orders.	1.1498498704709614
Human rights	-0.0
I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy.	1.0093371539783387
Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system.	0.9477936591995191
Against this background, I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler' s extermination of the Jews is being held, which is obviously a welcome initiative.	0.8503614118120421
So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.	1.162938431814072
You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States.	1.0599889196545604

In the capacity of coordinator of the European People' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into.	0.9231554356007754
Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends.	0.819014586979688
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	1.211197686427977

If, by chance, it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, then this could be suggested, both by Member States, and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group.	1.0634514784760472
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands.	0.9883982531578686
Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat. But we all want to be oarsmen on it.	1.0466298653000246
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem.	0.7781919676446855
This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent.	0.7957337082906334
I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack, either before trial or following judgement.	0.5809244941345059
May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market.	1.02808582609611
The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped.	0.7889306691209288
Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them.	1.0418138447207954
. (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, of course, to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive.	0.9393522881405842
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon, and I share his view.	1.0891725636943044
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council, and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense.	0.7486788184881609
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.	0.8343302489294527
Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals.	0.8013160354552683
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings, I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me, on the basis of our shared experience, in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok, are going to be working.	0.9879256500796472
Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days.	0.9364773586431491
So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen.	0.886330368028007
But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies.	0.9042117369593912
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing.	0.8095884815400421
I would ask you to use the full name of our Group.	0.947493770002434
During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region, and not just their own, which in my case happens three or four times a month, to engage in direct dialogue with the public, and not just with the élite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course.	1.014363145185977
Overall, I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position.	0.8745454719238458
In contrast, at European level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and Tour Operators, for example a regulation of such relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in collaboration with representatives from the two branches.	0.9328289056027079
As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems.	0.9561408387314256
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems as if the world is turned upside down.	0.9056784605458064
In the coming weeks, the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006. During these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation.	1.0798269088663004
We know that we can change this situation, in which women are underrepresented in the science sector, only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and, when they have obtained their degrees, by means of positive measures at the professional level.	0.9540741521111378
This is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy, the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR. This convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action.	1.1280512733295776
The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis' .	0.8768037114086139
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans, then we must have a level playing field.	0.9897281963225386
Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe.	0.4825112737914089
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs.	0.6894448757143447
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?	0.678490418915938
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.	0.6365086853614296
In the French version that becomes 'entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques' .	0.42740951653223563
It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective.	0.8794820396862515
Madam President, Mr Prodi, we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome.	0.9884396112272261
Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished.	1.0016839096995023
In the meantime, they have been forming governments in German federal states.	0.9028781285793129
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough.	0.681176969767003
Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.	1.016970366295878
Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect.	0.7811723681215548
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission.	0.9575372520695428
I believe that this should be applied to all areas, in particular also the budgetary area.	1.336239441238853
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.	0.6857453967847975
If we simply import raw materials from these developing countries, rather than allowing them the add-on value of producing their finished articles in their own country, we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations.	0.8024143873470825
Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, "The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally."	0.7206402665300236
I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work, which has been carried out under difficult conditions.	1.1715801065866882
Europe was born out of a desire for peace, freedom and tolerance.	0.6095185134994265
At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition.	0.7791521619113733
What we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty, as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact, in this instance, have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples.	0.9566537481860307
So, really, these bodies should already provide for a balance, and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process.	1.0534089868989633
We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason.	0.7283225026729445
There is ,of course, elasticity of demand, in this case a price elasticity of demand.	0.8655127924840962
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto.	0.7413842078760706
However, it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant Community legislation, for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or heeding the obligation to render an account of their use of Italian and European public finances.	1.0117397603440308
Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive.	0.8773584217186459
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.	0.6480852279832723
This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool' s bargain for French taxpayers.	0.7368093575708246
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people.	0.7320225179131775
Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.	0.687073840389865
And secondly: are we reducing the European car industry' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal?	0.7841476046405779
Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted.	0.9136661313882422
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon.	0.6492819188113466
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here.	1.0122086527838898
Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that.	1.100109978631152
However, more work is needed on this.	0.8290682348463988
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.	0.7858894549375932
In the interests of equality, there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment.	0.7370002499432868
In my view, the most important consequence, however, is that countries should do some careful thinking and, above all, make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites.	0.9530808727503965
As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country.	0.952521266657734
For that reason, in conclusion, I believe we should do something, particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws, not those relating to organised criminal activity, but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena.	1.0650633889367902
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures.	0.9825828977720628
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled?	0.5269241255358303
The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies.	0.4624729737396624
. (IT) Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has already pointed out, we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations.	1.1290482391612484
This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	1.040862164175566
The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage.	0.7800714074500833
For the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves.	0.5701722274280885
This talks of the European Union as 'living proof that peace, stability, freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent' and as a model showing the world the way forward. It concludes that 'our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity, and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so' .	0.9420735585555712
Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe.	1.2013704548071586
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.	0.9751094513544091
Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add).	0.8790088279744016
Firstly, there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players, by which I mean donors, requiring greater coordination, greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems.	0.7845654813538578
I cannot answer that question.	0.33066849023979017
Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature.	0.8643158537014733
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern.	0.7728649480980134
Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms.	1.0685232704061982
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown.	0.8053857033983376
As far as a European asylum law is concerned, a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere.	0.7767793956742666
All the foreign troops, including therefore the Syrian forces, must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council.	0.674393748502569
Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration.	0.6103412094697002
At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally, we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions.	1.0165191923829069
In so far as tourism falls within the political domain, it should be at national, regional and local level.	0.8526972849998968
We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and this Parliament has done the same.	1.0043270872041534
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is.	0.9101667376419036
We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries.	0.9708982551185761
Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable.	1.362657985569181
Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control.	0.9240186717968077
Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy.	1.0644667612755496
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan' s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution.	1.1160232103898697
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises.	0.6273540675551726
The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice.	1.1704027325715858
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.	0.7092657061960268
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region.	1.0104956155649774
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.	0.5835058884772601
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed.	0.8873323303146481
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date.	0.9578257388001756
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families.	1.2443851556876997
This is precisely why the European Union is maintaining all its sanctions until Yugoslavia' s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend.	0.9324447898660525
In his poem "Herinneringen aan Holland" [ "Reminiscing about Holland" ], a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too, which, with its never-ending trail of destruction, was feared and respected.	0.9306239278310874
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, barring a few exceptions.	0.7539996602121166
There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings.	0.8809384223900619
For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty.	0.9323867881510743
Clearly, the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems, seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage, particularly our water resources.	0.8437595421414997
We know what the problem is: instability on the markets as the result of speculation.	0.7228094003931324
The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty.	0.6687112129623816
The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules.	0.7475719922989242
But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is.	0.700784790716204
The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right!	1.0379060709138537
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say. Nevertheless, I would like to commend her on her work.	0.8503593510975865

We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement.	0.8981803710033218

What is a fair society?	0.8317666792357782
However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines.	1.1127485762664864
He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.	0.9097844809361393
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests.	0.9249226489445703
This applies to Amendment No 5, excluding section 1; 8 and 9, section 1; 10 and 12, section 3; 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25.	0.6156452514342776
Furthermore, it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas, climatic diversity, desert areas and arid areas.	0.727063665524828
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle?	0.6001035335829745
In April 1999, the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment.	0.8264614501340007
Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45.	0.8949919883622931
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.	0.7238262572372154
Let us remember what is at stake here.	0.6654771345545264
As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy.	1.151358579823292
A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war.	0.9682105278867204
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report.	0.8435423030194986
The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Palestinians, who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C, despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements. Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999, 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated, 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak' s Government.	0.7623557983026512
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures.	0.864200713234891
Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki.	1.0010815847613008
I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within.	0.8007676995249886
That is what we expect of you in the next five years.	0.8032630846216283
I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or I will come and get them from you later on.	0.8734010215370145
If we do things properly, this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy.	0.9473659011800225
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.	0.9985813562461172
We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support.	0.60922739144692
We are therefore all to blame.	0.8855429811505375
But you never lost hope and history proved you right.	0.2729698293330124
That is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time.	0.9160884535139973
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons.	0.8126489242717844
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the Commission, and perhaps of the Union itself.	0.9176997357017825
Mr President, this is not exactly a point of order but concerns a communication we have before us today, namely that the Conference of Presidents open to Members, which was scheduled for 23 February, has now been cancelled.	1.1238508956113753
However, having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees, I recognise that this was not feasible.	1.1900479625232425
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.	0.9243893559238361

What is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok, one of the most important parties in the Flemish region, if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible, indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals, the Volksunie, which seeks quite simply to abolish the party?	0.703569743738879

This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity, Mr Byrne, to give the Commission a few things to think about.	1.0877774740847002
My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well.	1.228106750414837

Even by this stage, that is already too many by far.	0.8678075117720081
And at the level of the European Union, the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked.	0.8861596448031396

It is not a quota!	1.1493266496007812

I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni.	1.1322685616623356
But the Council' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts.	0.770021529790331
Mr President, there are three points I wish to address.	0.9015965537377238
If I have not already done so, I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	0.998190595766124

Why has the Council not informed us of this?	0.7499955675771205
The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered.	0.7857892831887922
I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail.	1.0252945763737424
The opening of a building which was not finished, in the middle of an election campaign, which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied, makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous.	0.9186895732797261
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage.	0.8469586985807291
I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them.	1.012385722693287
We need proper information, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past.	0.9466623419653221
I hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration. I also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in Tampere, including Spain, will work diligently to apply these.	1.030191671051737
For example, it has not been defined.	1.1662464674117523
It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union.	0.7980937997442493
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment.	0.8155940777800353
However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision.	1.165626730133252
After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC.	1.0306801552593154

National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time.	0.7183928674066656
Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing, braking or hindering cross-border mobility.	0.5005950165906862
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded, but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information, or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission.	0.8085443996690984
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see.	0.7437586581833776

Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments, involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria.	0.644220402041686
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either.	0.9647365769710029
Instead, we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area.	1.0103559102368629
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.	0.827654862491268
On a separate matter altogether, I would like to support Cuba' s membership as an ACP country within the framework of the new Lomé Convention which will shortly be agreed between the European Union and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.	0.7032128725159877
I would therefore ask the Commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens.	0.7635380587657443
But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position.	0.6455870901231577

On the other hand, we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a) materials that are easier to recycle and (b) to set up recycling industries.	0.8672612463953635
The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo' s administration.	0.6643585206952072
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking.	0.872020155518105
The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax.	0.6211720506379942
It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned.	0.862680477140213
We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.	0.7597179107518777
The question is then, of course, where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers?	0.8770705604436111
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective.	0.9957091968045154
Because the issue is to be decided upon in March in the Council, Parliament has cause to adopt a position on the proposal now, so that the Member States have time also to take due account of Parliament' s points of view in the decision which has to be made in March.	1.0981472288133887
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the Commission will do, and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. However, you also said something which I find particularly frightening.	1.0424364008388314
We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside' s problems, which are characterised by the decline of farming, which was and should remain the countryside' s basic social and economic branch.	1.0095885930051904

The delta of the Danube is in danger.	0.6932213961898348
I would like to say, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, that in its judgement of 5 October 1999, the European Court of Justice ruled that this transfer, which was approved, was in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation 37/60/92 and, specifically, with its Article 9(1), which stipulates that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated.	1.105073697159669
So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind.	1.0209670990689363
Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units.	1.1326057007931254

I am waiting for the Commission' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.	1.1152846736198216
It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister.	0.8171757191861748

We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive.	0.83384328062148
The problems in Europe' s urban areas are getting worse; fortunately, we now have consensus with the Commission.	0.919212786476411

In the past, workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival. Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant.	0.791631563992838

I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology, i.e. the correct way to quote.	0.8107951628734325
